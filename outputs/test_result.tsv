we consider the <unk> with a <unk> on the <unk> . we are interested in studying <unk> , very much in the same spirit than the usual <unk> for the <unk> . we first show that <unk> attains an optimal <unk> bound in the sense that for any <unk> its <unk> is bounded from above by 14 √ <unk> . this result is <unk> in the sense that there exists a <unk> such that any algorithm has a <unk> bounded from below by 1 20 √ <unk> . we also study the case of <unk> for the setting of <unk> et al. -lsb- 2013 -rsb- -lrb- where the optimal mean is known as well as a lower bound on the smallest gap -rrb- and we show that in this case the regret of <unk> is in fact uniformly bounded over time , thus showing that <unk> can greatly take advantage of the nice properties of these <unk> .

we address the problem of estimating the <unk> of an <unk> without using <unk> . this is an important problem which is faced by the designers of new applications which use <unk> . quick estimate of <unk> early in the <unk> can be used to guide the decisions involving <unk> and <unk> . our approach involves estimating the <unk> of the <unk> produced by the underlying <unk> given the <unk> . a critical component of this system is a <unk> which seeks to capture the errors made by <unk> on the <unk> at a <unk> . we use a <unk> composed of <unk> which are learned from <unk> obtained by <unk> of the training set . we show reasonably close estimation of <unk> when applying the system to test sets from different domains .

existing research on <unk> mainly uses <unk> and phrases to determine <unk> expressed in <unk> and sentences . techniques have also been developed to find such words and phrases using dictionaries and domain corpora . however , there are still other types of words and phrases that do not bear <unk> on their own , but when they appear in some particular contexts , they imply <unk> . one class of such words or phrases is those that express resources such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc. . for example , '' this <unk> uses a lot of <unk> '' is negative but '' this <unk> uses little <unk> '' is positive . extracting such <unk> and phrases are important for <unk> . this paper formulates the problem based on a <unk> and proposes a novel <unk> to solve the problem . experimental results using diverse <unk> show good results .

we consider the problem of <unk> lying on multiple <unk> of unknown and possibly different dimensions . we show that one can represent the <unk> with a set of <unk> whose derivatives at a data point give normal vectors to the <unk> associated with the data point . since the <unk> can be estimated linearly from data , <unk> is reduced to classifying one point per <unk> . we do so by choosing points in the data set that minimize a <unk> . a basis for the complement of each <unk> is then recovered by applying standard <unk> to the set of derivatives -lrb- normal vectors -rrb- at those points . the final result is a new <unk> for <unk> based on simple <unk> . our experiments show that our <unk> outperforms existing <unk> based on <unk> and provides a good <unk> to <unk> such as <unk> and <unk> . we also present applications of <unk> on <unk> such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .

efficient two-step algorithms are described for optimizing the <unk> of the <unk> for <unk> either in the <unk> or in the least-mean-square sense subject to the maximum allowable <unk> . the first step involves finding a good <unk> using a simple technique . this <unk> is improved in the second step by using <unk> . several examples are included illustrating the flexibility of the proposed <unk> for making compromises between the required <unk> and the <unk> . these examples show that by allowing very small amplitude and <unk> , the stopband performance of the resulting <unk> is significantly improved compared to the corresponding <unk> . alternatively , the <unk> and , consequently , the overall delay can be significantly reduced to achieve practically the same performance .

in this work we describe two distinct novel improvements to our <unk> , previously proposed for <unk> . the first approach focuses on recurrent selection of <unk> for <unk> while the other is based on <unk> . the former selects <unk> with high relevance to <unk> , especially from a <unk> , and keeps updating them throughout <unk> . the latter statistically models <unk> between meeting participants and applies it as a <unk> when refining diarization results . experimental results reveal that the two proposed approaches provide performance enhancement by <unk> % -lrb- relative -rrb- in terms of <unk> in tests on 13 meeting excerpts from various <unk> .

we model the responses of cells in <unk> during <unk> . our model consists of a <unk> whose output is divided by <unk> and texture contrast mechanisms . we apply this model to review movies , a <unk> that <unk> the stimulation a cell receives during free viewing of <unk> . data were collected from three cells using five different review movies , and the model was fit separately to the data from each movie . for the <unk> alone we find modest but significant correlations -lrb- re = <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , 0.35 -rrb- between model and data . these correlations are improved somewhat when we allow for <unk> -lrb- re + g = <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -rrb- . in one case the inclusion of a <unk> dramatically improves the fit to the data by modifying the time course of the model 's response .

the most popular <unk> , the <unk> , suffers from <unk> when <unk> undergoes changes in pitch . these relatively fast variations lead to <unk> in frequency domain and can not be accurately described by the <unk> with high resolution both in time and frequency . in this paper a new <unk> , called <unk> is presented , offering more precise time-frequency representation of speech signals . the base of this <unk> is composed of <unk> that follow the <unk> . comparative results between the proposed <unk> and popular <unk> reveal an improvement in <unk> and finer <unk> . since the signal can be resynthesized from its <unk> , the proposed <unk> is also suitable for <unk> .

our goal is to obtain a <unk> , from an observed , noisy , low resolution -lrb- lr -rrb- <unk> . the conventional approach of preprocessing the <unk> with a <unk> , followed by applying a <unk> , has an important limitation : along with <unk> , some high frequency content of the <unk> -lrb- particularly textural detail -rrb- is invariably lost during the <unk> . this ` denoising loss ' restricts the performance of the subsequent <unk> , wherein the challenge is to synthesize such <unk> . in this paper , we show that high frequency content in the <unk> -lrb- which is <unk> removed by <unk> -rrb- can be effectively used to obtain the <unk> in the <unk> . to do so , we first obtain <unk> of both the <unk> , using a <unk> . we then show that by taking a <unk> of orientation and frequency selective bands of the noisy and the denoised <unk> , we can obtain a desired <unk> where -lrb- i -rrb- some of the <unk> lost in the <unk> is effectively recovered in the <unk> , and -lrb- ii -rrb- additional textures can be easily synthesized by appropriately constraining the parameters of the <unk> . we show that this <unk> through our algorithm yields <unk> that are visually more pleasing than those obtained using the conventional <unk> . furthermore , our results show a consistent improvement in <unk> , further <unk> the ability of our algorithm to recover <unk> .

we examined the sequence of <unk> that are encountered in the game of <unk> and found that most of the problems are easy in the following sense : one can choose well among the available actions without knowing an <unk> that scores well in the game . this is a consequence of three conditions that are prevalent in the game : simple <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . these conditions can be exploited to develop faster and more effective <unk> . in addition , they allow certain types of <unk> to be incorporated with ease into a <unk> . among the <unk> we encounter , it is unlikely that <unk> is unique or rare in having these properties .

techniques such as <unk> and <unk> have been shown to be broadly useful at automatically extracting the <unk> , or more generally for <unk> . these types of models and algorithms can be viewed as generating an <unk> from the words in a document to a <unk> that captures what the document is generally about beyond the specific words it contains . in this paper we propose a new <unk> that <unk> this <unk> by representing each document as a combination of -lrb- a -rrb- a <unk> over <unk> , -lrb- b -rrb- a <unk> over general topics , and -lrb- c -rrb- a <unk> over words that are treated as being specific to that document . we illustrate how this <unk> can be used for <unk> by matching documents both at a general topic level and at a specific <unk> , providing an advantage over techniques that only match documents at a general level -lrb- such as <unk> or <unk> -rrb- or that only match documents at the specific <unk> -lrb- such as tf-idf -rrb- .

multistage residual vector quantizers -lrb- <unk> -rrb- with optimal <unk> have been successfully designed and implemented for <unk> . due to its <unk> , <unk> has the ability to densely populate the <unk> with <unk> . the same design concept has yielded good results in the application of <unk> -lsb- 1 -rsb- . furthermore , the <unk> , with <unk> , provides an opportunity to perform <unk> for <unk> , in general , and feature foundation data generation for <unk> , in specific . in -lsb- 1 -rsb- , the information at the stages of <unk> is heuristically integrated to perform <unk> ; hence the process is not robust . <unk> provides a suitable <unk> to integrate the information available at the various stages of <unk> to achieve <unk> in the <unk> .

in this work we make use of recent advances in <unk> to improve standard approaches for <unk> and <unk> . <unk> has become feasible and shown to work reliably on <unk> . information about the <unk> contributes crucial information about the <unk> in cases where standard approaches struggle . we describe , how the responses of such a <unk> can be included in <unk> . one of the strengths of our <unk> is , that we can use the <unk> for a whole set of directions and let the final optimization decide about the <unk> . this is important in cases where based on the <unk> , multiple different <unk> seem likely . we evaluate our <unk> on two challenging <unk> for the two proposed applications . for the <unk> we use <unk> taken from a car and for the <unk> we use <unk> taken in <unk> .

one goal of <unk> is to produce <unk> that presents information in a <unk> . in this paper , we show that <unk> , which model <unk> , are an important component of <unk> in <unk> . first , we show in a sentence ordering experiment that <unk> improves the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> -lrb- 2008 -rrb- more than <unk> and simple <unk> do , particularly when <unk> of this information are not available . then , we incorporate the model enhanced with <unk> into a <unk> that generates <unk> for <unk> , and show that the added <unk> improves performance slightly , though not statistically significantly .

this paper considers application of <unk> to <unk> . <unk> have been successfully applied to a number of tasks , including <unk> , thanks to the recent discovery of an efficient <unk> . <unk> learn a <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> discovered by this <unk> are then used to initialize a <unk> which is fine-tuned with <unk> . we compare a <unk> to three widely used <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . the <unk> gives a call -- routing classification accuracy that is equal to the best of the other models even though <unk> currently uses an impoverished representation of the input .

<unk> optimization via <unk> has become very popular for <unk> in <unk> and is often combined with a <unk> , known as <unk> . this paper introduces this combination as a general and effective <unk> . it is the first time that this concept is applied to <unk> . the presented algorithm , <unk> , employs a <unk> and reduces the <unk> for <unk> by a fixed linear rate . this allows it to handle large displacements to an extent that is required for <unk> in <unk> . <unk> is evaluated in context of <unk> on the recently extended <unk> benchmark that provides ten 4d computed tomography -lrb- ct -rrb- image data sets , as well as ten challenging <unk> from the <unk> . results show that both <unk> as well as run-time performance are very competitive with current state-of-the-art methods .

this article deals with <unk> and <unk> with <unk> by <unk> . on this topic , the search community is divided into two parts : analysis and synthesis . we want to use all the knowledge to create a <unk> where the <unk> needs the <unk> and conversely . as it happens , applications like <unk> or <unk> need a rapid , robust and <unk> solution . our solution is based on a <unk> : the first step is a <unk> with <unk> and the second step recovers a <unk> in order to extract more precise parameters to adjust the first step . the contribution of this paper is to couple two research fields for creating a <unk> . the results obtained show rapid and robust performances which could be exploited in a more <unk> .

this paper presents a <unk> for <unk> , which in their general form can also be called <unk> . <unk> assign a score to each object independently , without taking into account the other objects under consideration ; whereas <unk> evaluate the set of scores assigned to all objects as a whole . in many <unk> to <unk> , it might be of interest to use <unk> instead ; in particular , the <unk> might themselves be listwise , especially if the <unk> is listwise . a key <unk> to using <unk> has been the lack of an appropriate <unk> for such functions . we show that a <unk> that we call exchangeability allows us to explicitly characterize the set of such <unk> . our analysis draws from the theories of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . we also present experiments using a novel <unk> motivated by our <unk> .

in <unk> , <unk> force the user to repeat information resulting in more turns , lower <unk> and maybe complete failure . <unk> such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> can improve performance but are hard to quantify and effectively include in the <unk> . in this paper , <unk> is used to improve <unk> . by permitting the <unk> to guide the interaction it is possible to track the <unk> and thus estimate the expected semantic content of the user 's response . the <unk> is allowed to process a large number of sentences provided by the <unk> . <unk> is used as an effective criterion for selecting among competing hypotheses . this approach was tested with a simple <unk> and results show improvement in <unk> without adding significant computation .

in this paper we propose a simple but efficient <unk> for solving the <unk> . our new <unk> combines the benefits of <unk> using <unk> and <unk> to train a set of <unk> . each of our <unk> captures a <unk> and is trained by searching over all possible sub-windows of the images in a <unk> . each <unk> is represented in a <unk> and uses <unk> for learning both shape and texture patterns of the scene . the final response of the <unk> form a single feature vector which we call the <unk> and can be used for the <unk> . we tested our proposed <unk> in three datasets which contain a variety of scene categories -lrb- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> -rrb- . our <unk> obtains state-of-the-art results on all these datasets which shows that <unk> can simultaneously model the <unk> in a single framework and is general enough to be used for both <unk> .

essence is a new <unk> for specifying <unk> in a manner similar to <unk> that use a mixture of <unk> and <unk> . <unk> provides a high level of <unk> , much of which is the consequence of the provision of <unk> whose values can be <unk> , such as <unk> , sets , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and functions . <unk> also allows these <unk> to be nested to <unk> , thus providing , for example , sets of <unk> , sets of sets of <unk> , and so forth . therefore , a problem that requires finding a <unk> can be directly specified by using a <unk> whose type is precisely that <unk> .

polarized dependency -lrb- pd - -rrb- grammars are proposed as a means of efficient treatment of <unk> . <unk> describe two kinds of <unk> : <unk> , explicitly derived by the <unk> , and long , implicitly specified by <unk> . if in a <unk> the number of <unk> in <unk> is bounded by a constant , then it is weakly equivalent to a <unk> and has a cents ¡ $ # ¦ ¥ ¨ § - time parsing algorithm . it happens that such <unk> are strong enough to express such phenomena as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .

developing individualized head related transfer functions -lrb- <unk> -rrb- is an essential requirement for accurate <unk> . however it is time consuming and complicated for both the subject and the developer . obtaining the <unk> which are the most prominent features of <unk> is very important to reconstruct the head related impulse response -lrb- <unk> -rrb- accurately . in this paper , a method suitable for fast computation of the frequencies of <unk> is proposed . the <unk> is used to compute the <unk> with a high degree of <unk> in this work . subsequent use of <unk> to overlay the <unk> on the <unk> indicate that the proposed method is able to provide finer contours . experiments on reconstruction of the <unk> indicates that the method performs better than other methods .

description logics , and in particular the <unk> has been proposed as an appropriate basis for computing matches between <unk> for the sake of <unk> and <unk> . a drawback of the direct use of <unk> as a <unk> is the inability to compute <unk> and <unk> the degree of <unk> . in this paper , we describe a method for overcoming these problems that is based on <unk> . in particular , we approximate the <unk> by defining the notion of <unk> with respect to a certain subset of the concept and relation names . we present the formal semantics of this relation , describe a <unk> for <unk> and discuss its application to <unk> .

we recently proposed a family of <unk> for recognizing the three <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> -- from <unk> . these were based on both <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and pitch <unk> . this paper aims to study the <unk> of these four categories of <unk> in this <unk> . three measures are considered : the number of <unk> from each category when all <unk> are used in selection , the <unk> when each category is used separately , and the <unk> when a category is excluded from <unk> . we find that the <unk> is in the order of <unk> > energy ≈ pitch > duration . additionally , <unk> almost always improves performance , and locally weighted fusion always outperforms <unk> regardless of the number of <unk> used .

the <unk> based on <unk> is known to have certain weaknesses . partial solutions to these flaws have been presented , but the fundamental problem remains : compression of the data to a compact <unk> discards useful information such as <unk> and <unk> . in this paper , we look at <unk> as a solution to this problem . by replacing the <unk> with the underlying examples , all information in the training data is retained . we show how information about <unk> can be used , introducing a new interpretation of <unk> . the basis for the <unk> is the well-known <unk> , which has often been used for small tasks . however , <unk> introduces new demands , resulting in an explosion of the <unk> . we show how this problem can be tackled using a <unk> which selects appropriate <unk> as candidates for <unk> .

spectral <unk> based on the <unk> is a widely used '' preprocessing '' step in many <unk> , typically leading to <unk> by projecting onto a number of <unk> and rescaling the <unk> -lrb- by a <unk> of the singular value -rrb- . however , the number of such vectors required to capture <unk> grows with <unk> , and even <unk> becomes a bottleneck . in this paper , we propose a <unk> , which employs <unk> and <unk> to compute approximations to <unk> . for an <unk> with <unk> , its <unk> is o -lrb- -lrb- t + m + n -rrb- log -lrb- m + n -rrb- -rrb- , and the <unk> is o -lrb- log -lrb- m + n -rrb- -rrb- , both of which are independent of the number of <unk> whose effect we wish to capture . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to circumvent this dependence on the number of <unk> for <unk> . the key to <unk> the <unk> is the observation that , for <unk> such as <unk> and classification , we are only interested in using the resulting <unk> to evaluate <unk> derived from the ℓ 2-norm , rather than capturing the effect of the underlying <unk> on <unk> as a partial <unk> tries to do . our numerical results on <unk> demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed <unk> , and motivate further exploration of its application to <unk> .

our goal in this work was to develop an accurate method to identify <unk> , ultimately for the purpose of <unk> . our previous work used <unk> to perform <unk> using <unk> , including <unk> and pitch , and achieved a 7.9 % <unk> on our test set . we improved upon our previous results by including <unk> , <unk> , and performing segmentation via a <unk> with <unk> . upon including the <unk> and <unk> , our results improved to 5.4 % <unk> on our test set and 2.7 % <unk> on an <unk> used by others . after attaining segmentation results by incorporating the <unk> and <unk> , we had a <unk> % <unk> and <unk> % <unk> on our test set . to our knowledge these are the best known <unk> results on the <unk> to date .

we propose a simple <unk> for <unk> . our <unk> uses attention to decompose the problem into subprob-lems that can be solved separately , thus making it trivially parallelizable . on the <unk> , we obtain state-of-the-art results with almost an order of magnitude fewer parameters than previous work and without relying on any <unk> . adding <unk> that takes a minimum amount of order into account yields further improvements .

in this paper , we propose a novel framework to integrate <unk> into <unk> . this is achieved by using <unk> of different <unk> -lrb- estimated by <unk> -rrb- directly as <unk> in <unk> . on the <unk> , the proposed framework yields a <unk> of <unk> % which is comparable to <unk> using <unk> as <unk> -lrb- <unk> % -rrb- . furthermore , a best performance of <unk> % <unk> is achieved by jointly modeling <unk> and <unk> as <unk> . this shows the efficacy and flexibility of the proposed approach .

we consider the problem of quickly localizing multiple targets by asking questions of the form '' how many targets are within this set '' while obtaining noisy answers . this setting is a generalization to multiple targets of the game of 20 questions in which only a single target is queried . we assume that the targets are points on the real line , or in a two dimensional plane for the experiments , drawn independently from a <unk> . we evaluate the performance of a policy using the expected entropy of the <unk> after a fixed number of questions with noisy answers . we derive a lower bound for the value of this problem and study a specific policy , named the <unk> . we show that this policy achieves a value which is no more than twice this lower bound when answers are noise-free , and show a more general <unk> for the <unk> . we present an empirical evaluation of this policy on <unk> for the problem of detecting multiple instances of the same object in an image . finally , we present experiments on <unk> simultaneously on <unk> .

the classical way of <unk> in <unk> is by means of <unk> . however agents are not always able to deliver such a function directly . in this paper , we relate three different ways of specifying preferences , namely by means of a set of particular types of <unk> on the <unk> , by means of an ordered set of <unk> expressed by <unk> , and by means of an ordered set of subsets of possible candidates reaching the same level of satisfaction . these different <unk> can be handled in a <unk> , here the one of <unk> . the <unk> pertaining to different criteria can then be handled by fusing sets of <unk> . apart from a better <unk> , the benefits of a <unk> are to put them in a suitable format for <unk> , or for modifying or revising them .

for the purpose of efficient <unk> at <unk> , a new <unk> is proposed in this paper . the basic idea behind this <unk> is '' give bits to the band with the maximum <unk> '' or '' retrieve bits from the band with the maximum <unk> '' . the notion of '' <unk> efficiency '' is suggested and <unk> can be employed to construct a <unk> operated at <unk> as compared to the traditional <unk> . based on this <unk> a new <unk> , called <unk> , is designed for the <unk> . simulation results show that the performance of the <unk> is significantly better than that of the <unk> and is close to that of <unk> -lsb- 3 -rsb- , which is the -lrb- nearly -rrb- optimal solution . moreover , the <unk> has the advantages of <unk> comparing to <unk> .

hashing has been widely applied to approximate nearest neighbor search for <unk> . <unk> improves the quality of <unk> by exploiting the <unk> on <unk> and has received increasing attention recently . for most existing <unk> for <unk> , an image is first represented as a vector of <unk> , then quantized by a separate <unk> that generates <unk> . however , <unk> may be produced , since the <unk> is not statistically minimized and the <unk> is not optimally compatible with the <unk> . in this paper , we propose a novel <unk> for <unk> , which learns <unk> for <unk> and formally control the <unk> . the <unk> constitutes four key components : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a <unk> with multiple <unk> to capture <unk> ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- a fully connected bottleneck layer to generate <unk> optimal for <unk> ; -lrb- 3 -rrb- a <unk> for <unk> ; and -lrb- 4 -rrb- a <unk> for controlling <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> . extensive experiments on standard <unk> show the proposed <unk> yields substantial boosts over latest state-of-the-art <unk> .

this paper presents a <unk> with the <unk> r = 1 = 3 and the constraint length k = 9 -lrb- 256 states -rrb- . this <unk> has been implemented using 0.5 m <unk> and is targeted for <unk> for next generation wireless applications such as <unk> and <unk> . the <unk> is expected to operate at <unk> under 3.3 v and at <unk> under 1.8 v . the <unk> have been designed using <unk> , which has made it feasible to execute 256 <unk> in parallel . for <unk> , we have developed a novel <unk> and an <unk> , which was designed considering that 256 bits should be written simultaneously for write operations but only one bit needs to be accessed for read operations . we have estimated that the <unk> dissipates only <unk> at <unk> under 1.8 v.

statistical approaches for building <unk> , such as the <unk> , have enjoyed great popularity in recent years , but typically require tedious <unk> . in this paper , a <unk> for the <unk> from a single <unk> is presented and demonstrated on the example of <unk> that can be used for building <unk> for <unk> and <unk> . this <unk> employs the idea of initially learning the <unk> in a <unk> and a set of training images with a face in arbitrary poses . using this learner , <unk> at any <unk> for which the learner was trained can be reconstructed by predicting the new <unk> and warping the <unk> from the <unk> . <unk> are then built from the <unk> and used for automatically annotating <unk> , including images of different facial expressions , at any random pose within the <unk> spanned by the virtually <unk> . the <unk> is experimentally validated by <unk> from three different databases .

we examine the <unk> when <unk> uses <unk> for its set of <unk> and bound its <unk> in terms of the number of training errors and the number of <unk> <unk> achieves on the training data . we show that <unk> provides a favorable alternative to <unk> on some <unk> . compared to the <unk> , the <unk> with <unk> produces substantially sparser clas-sifiers with comparable -lrb- and sometimes better -rrb- generalization . furthermore , we show that our bound on the <unk> provides an effective guide for <unk> .

this paper considers the <unk> in the <unk> . we introduce two methods based on the sparsity assumption of the sources in the <unk> . the first one assumes that the sources are <unk> in the <unk> ; i.e. there is at most one source signal present at a given point in the <unk> . in the second method , we relax this assumption by allowing the sources to be <unk> to a certain extent . in particular , the number of sources present -lrb- active -rrb- at a <unk> should be strictly less than the number of sensors . in that case , the <unk> can be achieved thanks to <unk> which allows us to identify the <unk> and to estimate their corresponding <unk> .

user-provided object <unk> is a simple and popular <unk> considered by many existing <unk> . however , these frameworks tend to exploit the provided <unk> merely to exclude its exterior from consideration and sometimes to initialize the <unk> . in this paper , we discuss how the <unk> can be further used to impose a powerful <unk> , which prevents the solution from <unk> and ensures that the <unk> bounds the segmentation in a sufficiently tight way . the <unk> is expressed using <unk> incorporated into the <unk> leading to an <unk> . we then investigate the possible <unk> including <unk> as well as a new <unk> called <unk> . the latter can be used either as a <unk> for the <unk> , which is provably better than <unk> , or as a fast <unk> . we evaluate the proposed algorithms on a <unk> , and demonstrate the practical benefits of the new <unk> both qualitatively and quantitatively .

assessing similarity between <unk> is a key step in <unk> and <unk> . we argue that knowledge on the <unk> generated by <unk> is crucial in deciding whether <unk> are similar or not . intuitively one would expect that similarities between <unk> could arise from any <unk> . in this paper , we will derive the contrary , and report the theoretical result that <unk> -- a class of commonly applied distance metrics -- from one <unk> to other vectors are <unk> if the <unk> are correlated and <unk> distributed . besides these assumptions being realistic for <unk> , we experimentally show them to hold for various popular <unk> , for a diverse range of <unk> . this fundamental insight opens new directions in the assessment of <unk> , with projected improvements in <unk> .

we present a new algorithm for <unk> for an optimization version of the <unk> called <unk> . the algorithm utilizes the <unk> which underlies several state-of-the-art algorithms for solving related problems . this bound computation can be used in a <unk> for solving <unk> . we then present a technique for pruning values from the <unk> based on the information available after each bound computation . we evaluated the proposed techniques in a <unk> and a <unk> . in both cases , our experiments showed that the new techniques improved the efficiency of state-of-the-art solvers by orders of magnitude .

the problem of assigning m points in the n-dimensional real space r n to k clusters is formulated as that of determining k centers in r n such that the sum of distances of each point to the nearest center is minimized . if a <unk> is used , the problem can be formulated as that of minimizing a <unk> on a <unk> which is shown to be equivalent to a <unk> : minimizing a <unk> on a <unk> . a <unk> consisting of solving few <unk> in <unk> leads to a stationary point of the <unk> . computational testing on a number of <unk> was carried out . on the <unk> , <unk> was comparable to that of the <unk> , however its testing set correctness was better . additionally , on the <unk> , distinct and clinically important <unk> were extracted by the <unk> , whereas the <unk> failed to obtain such distinct <unk> for the same database .

we investigate the use of <unk> to query <unk> in search of regions of similarity or critical relationships among the sequences . existing <unk> are insensitive to repeats , especially in <unk> , and do not provide much support for <unk> querying sub-sequences with inserts and <unk> -lrb- or gaps -rrb- . our <unk> uses <unk> and multiple transformations in the <unk> to map characters in a sequence as well as different properties of a <unk> , such as its position in the sequence or number of gaps between sub-sequences . we analyze <unk> using transformations in the <unk> while demonstrating the <unk> 's possible operation in real-time without <unk> . the <unk> 's performance is compared to the <unk> , and a <unk> is observed for queries with <unk> .

a recent trend in <unk> is <unk> and <unk> with ground truth provided by <unk> . in order to accommodate the strong <unk> humans have toward <unk> , <unk> is common to replace traditional <unk> with a <unk> which uses <unk> from other images in the database as the negative set . however , the <unk> roc introduces a number of problematic elements , including a fundamental assumption that <unk> is possible to separate <unk> and image spatial arrangement . we argue that <unk> is more informative to directly measure the effect of <unk> on algorithm performance rather than try to correct for <unk> . to capture and quantify these known sources of <unk> , we propose a novel metric for measuring <unk> performance : the spatially <unk> roc -lrb- <unk> -rrb- . this metric provides direct insight into the <unk> of a <unk> without sacrificing the intuitive raw performance evaluation of traditional <unk> . by quantitatively measuring the <unk> in <unk> , researchers will be better equipped to select and optimize the most appropriate algorithm for a given task . we use a baseline measure of inherent algorithm <unk> to show that <unk> -lsb- 14 -rsb- , attention by <unk> -lsb- 8 -rsb- , and <unk> -lsb- 20 -rsb- provide the least spatially biased results , <unk> them for tasks in which there is no information about the underlying <unk> of the stimuli , whereas algorithms such as <unk> -lsb- 18 -rsb- and <unk> -lsb- 15 -rsb- have a significant inherent central <unk> .

the <unk> has recently been introduced in the context of <unk> where <unk> was used to produce state-of-the-art results . given two vectors , their <unk> reflects the likelihood of each vector belonging in the same class as the other vector and not in a class defined by a fixed set of '' negative '' examples . the potential of this approach has thus far been largely <unk> . in this paper we analyze the <unk> and show that : -lrb- 1 -rrb- when using a version of <unk> as the underlying <unk> , this score is a <unk> and may be used within <unk> -lrb- e.g. , svm -rrb- , -lrb- 2 -rrb- <unk> can be efficiently computed , and -lrb- 3 -rrb- that <unk> is effective as an underlying mechanism for <unk> . we further demonstrate the effectiveness of the <unk> in a number of applications including <unk> and <unk> .

multi-task learning attempts to simultaneously leverage data from multiple domains in order to estimate related functions on each domain . for example , a special case of <unk> , <unk> , is often employed when one has a good estimate of a function on a <unk> , but is unable to estimate a related function well on a target domain using only target data . <unk> are usually solved by imposing some kind of '' smooth '' relationship <unk> tasks . in this paper , we study how different <unk> on <unk> affect the upper bounds of algorithms proposed for these <unk> under different settings . for general <unk> , we study a family of algorithms which utilize a <unk> on task weights to capture the smooth relationship among tasks , which has many instantiations in existing literature . furthermore , for <unk> in a <unk> , we study the recently proposed algorithms for the '' model shift '' , where the conditional distribution p -lrb- y | x -rrb- is allowed to change across tasks but the change is assumed to be smooth . in addition , we illustrate our results with experiments on both <unk> .

audio coding at <unk> suffers from artifacts due to <unk> . typical <unk> using transforms across the channels to remove <unk> such as middle -lrb- mid -rrb- - side -lrb- <unk> -rrb- coding . at <unk> , the spectrum of the <unk> is truncated and the spectrum of the channels with lower energy , such as the <unk> , is truncated severely , sometimes entirely . this results in a <unk> due to truncation of all <unk> beyond a certain frequency . it also results in a <unk> even at <unk> due to <unk> . previously we have developed a <unk> to combat the <unk> caused by <unk> . in this paper , we present a novel <unk> to mitigate the <unk> . listening tests show that the combination of the two <unk> results in a <unk> that can get good quality even at bitrates as low as <unk> for <unk> with <unk> .

previous <unk> to <unk> produce hypotheses in the form of a set of <unk> of a theory , where the <unk> represent allowed sequences of <unk> for the initial theory . there are , however , many characterizations of allowed sequences of <unk> that can not be expressed by a set of <unk> . one approach to this <unk> is presented , the system <unk> , which is based on an earlier technique for learning <unk> that represent allowed sequences of <unk> . <unk> extends the previous technique in three ways : i -rrb- negative examples are considered in addition to positive examples , ii -rrb- a new strategy for performing <unk> is used , and iii -rrb- a technique for converting the learned automaton to a <unk> is included . results from experiments are presented in which <unk> outperforms both a system using the old strategy for performing <unk> , and a traditional <unk> . the latter result can be explained by the limited expressiveness of hypotheses produced by covering and also by the fact that covering needs to produce the correct <unk> for a <unk> before producing the <unk> . <unk> on the other hand does not require that particular examples of the base cases are given , since both <unk> and <unk> can be inferred from a single example .

information extraction -lrb- <unk> -rrb- is the problem of lling out <unk> from <unk> . we are interested in performing <unk> in <unk> , where much of the text is often ungrammatical , such as <unk> and <unk> . we suggest that the best approach is one that takes into account many diierent kinds of information , and argue for the suitability of a <unk> . we describe <unk> for <unk> drawn from three separate <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . by building <unk> mapping from <unk> to <unk> and combining probabilities appropriately , it is possible to improve <unk> over that achieved by any individual learner . we describe three diierent <unk> . experiments on two <unk> , a collection of <unk> from a university computer science department and a set of <unk> describing corporate acquisitions from the <unk> , demonstrate the <unk> of all three <unk> .

online cursive handwriting recognition is currently one of the most intriguing challenges in <unk> . this study presents a novel approach to this <unk> which is composed of two complementary phases . the first is <unk> of the <unk> into a compact sequence of <unk> . in this <unk> we largely remove the redundancy of the script , while preserving most of its <unk> . in the second phase these <unk> are used to train <unk> for the important ingredients of the <unk> , e.g. letters . we present a new and efficient <unk> for such <unk> , and demonstrate its utility for <unk> . our experiments show that over 90 % of the letters are correctly spotted and identified , prior to any higher <unk> . moreover , both the <unk> are very efficient compared to other <unk> , and the <unk> are ` on-line ' adaptable to other writers and styles .

<unk> r-d optimized rate control for <unk> is investigated in this work . a <unk> is first presented based on a model of the relationship between the rate -lrb- r -rrb- and <unk> . with the modelled <unk> relationship , a <unk> is proposed to generate <unk> -lrb- video buffer verifier -rrb- compliant bitstream with <unk> . then , a <unk> is described by jointly selecting the <unk> and the <unk> in i , b and p pictures for both <unk> . to avoid the irregularly large mv or one single <unk> , we extend the set of <unk> modes of mb by including zero mv and zero texture bits as two more candidates . finally , <unk> are developed to reduce the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> in <unk> , which achieves <unk> results close to the optimal one at a much lower <unk> .

temporal processing and <unk> in <unk> are commonly used to aid in performance and <unk> in <unk> . among the techniques successfully employed are <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . the work here explores the use of <unk> using <unk> to further enhance performance using a few <unk> . in addition to <unk> , we apply the <unk> to <unk> and cepstra while making sure that the assumptions of <unk> are observed . we additionally test the use of <unk> that have been trained in different <unk> , noting from previous work that the presence of <unk> alters the preferred frequency range of the derived <unk> . our tests indicate a consistent advantage in <unk> . <unk> , in contrast , reveal that the <unk> often do not improve upon the existing <unk> previously used . they can also be made less <unk> by allowing <unk> to a <unk> .

one of the most difficult tasks in <unk> for <unk> is finding an <unk> that is expressive enough to capture the important structure in the <unk> , while at the same time not overfitting the training samples . recent results in <unk> , have demonstrated that this can be done effectively using nothing more than a <unk> on the <unk> . in this paper we extend these results to the case where samples come from <unk> instead of the full <unk> , adding <unk> to <unk> . in addition , we provide the first max-norm , finite sample performance guarantees for any form of <unk> . <unk> is amenable to problems with large -lrb- multidimensional -rrb- or even <unk> , and does not require a model to select actions using the resulting <unk> .

<unk> jamming poses a particularly diicult challenge for conventional <unk> . in such cases <unk> provides some <unk> when the target and <unk> are not exactly <unk> , but the resulting <unk> is too distorted to be suitable for <unk> . the presence of <unk> in the form of <unk> is normally considered a nuisance source of interference . however , it can also be exploited to suppress <unk> with <unk> . here we present a method for incorporating <unk> into <unk> to yield a <unk> with <unk> that can achieve far better <unk> and <unk> than has been previously possible . performance results for the <unk> are obtained for <unk> containing a <unk> and <unk> , that demonstrate a dramatic improvement in performance over conventional <unk> .

why does placing an object from one photograph into another often make the colors of that object suddenly look wrong ? one possibility is that humans prefer <unk> that are often found in nature ; that is , we find pleasing these <unk> that we see often . another possibility is that humans simply prefer colors to be consistent within an image , regardless of what they are . in this paper , we explore some of these issues by studying the color statistics of a large dataset of <unk> , and by looking at differences in <unk> in <unk> . we apply our findings to two problems : 1 -rrb- <unk> into realistic vs. <unk> , and 2 -rrb- <unk> for <unk> .

environmental <unk> present a challenge to current <unk> that analyze the <unk> , due to the complex texture and motion of the scene . they also present a challenge to <unk> that compare <unk> between the foreground and the background in each image independently , because objects of interest such as animals have adapted to blend in . therefore , we have developed a <unk> that analyzes the temporal variation of <unk> , instead of either looking at <unk> , or the <unk> in isolation . <unk> are less sensitive to movements of the <unk> , and at the same time <unk> are more robust than individual pixel statistics in <unk> . they also enable slow background update , which is crucial in <unk> where <unk> comes at a premium , and where <unk> , when present , may move less than the background and therefore disappear into it when a fast update scheme is used . our <unk> compares favorably with the state of the art both in <unk> , as well as in <unk> .

interruptible pure exploration in <unk> is a key component of <unk> for <unk> . we introduce <unk> , a novel family of strategies for pure exploration in <unk> , which allows for adapting recent advances in <unk> to the <unk> , while guaranteeing <unk> performance improvement over time . our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the corresponding instances of <unk> favorably compete both with the currently popular strategies <unk> and <unk> , as well as with the <unk> .

we study the problem of identifying individuals based on their <unk> during reading of arbitrary text . the motivation for this problem is an unobtrusive <unk> setting in which a user is observed during access to a document , but no specific challenge protocol requiring the user 's time and attention is carried out . existing models of individual differences in <unk> during reading are either based on simple <unk> , or rely on <unk> to describe , for instance , <unk> or <unk> . we develop <unk> of eye movements during reading in which densities are inferred under a <unk> prior centered at a <unk> that is expected to approximate the true distribution well . an empirical study on reading data from <unk> individuals shows significant improvements over the state of the art .

model-based methods for <unk> in <unk> require <unk> and often prior knowledge of participating speakers . we propose an <unk> to <unk> . based on <unk> , we first cluster voiced speech into two speaker groups by maximizing the ratio of <unk> <unk> distances penalized by <unk> . to group <unk> , we employ an <unk> to generate <unk> . <unk> are then labeled by the complementary portions of <unk> . our <unk> does not require any <unk> and is computationally simple . evaluations and comparisons show that the proposed <unk> outperforms a <unk> in terms of <unk> .

we introduce a new <unk> based on the concept of <unk> in subspace -lrb- <unk> -rrb- . given the training data of authentic samples and <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> tries to identify a <unk> in which all the authentic samples are close to each other and all the <unk> are far away from the authentic samples . the <unk> of the <unk> is determined by maximizing the minimal distance between the authentic samples and the <unk> in the <unk> . we present a procedure to achieve such <unk> and to identify the <unk> . the verification procedure is simple since we only need to project the test sample to the <unk> and compare it against the <unk> . using <unk> as an example , we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several other algorithms based on <unk> .

this paper presents a <unk> using <unk> to build <unk> of the source/target speakers , where <unk> is easier to convert the source speech to the target speech than in the traditional <unk> . <unk> have a <unk> that automatically discovers <unk> to maximally express the original input features . if we train the <unk> using only the speech of an individual speaker , <unk> can be considered that there is less <unk> and relatively more <unk> in the output features at the highest layer . training the <unk> for a source speaker and a target speaker , we can then connect and convert the <unk> using <unk> . the converted abstraction of the source speaker is then brought back to the <unk> using an <unk> of the <unk> of the target speaker . we conducted <unk> conversion experiments and confirmed the efficacy of our <unk> with respect to <unk> , comparing <unk> with the conventional <unk> .

this paper addresses the problem of <unk> in <unk> , where a different set of frequencies is sensed at different antenna locations . a <unk> is first employed to reconstruct all the signals simultaneously by exploiting <unk> and correlations between antenna signals . this is in contrast to previous approaches where the signal at each <unk> is reconstructed independently . furthermore , to promote <unk> and improve <unk> , a <unk> is employed in the <unk> . following <unk> , a <unk> is applied to remove <unk> , prior to <unk> . experimental results on real data show that the proposed approach produces significantly higher <unk> and requires far fewer measurements for forming <unk> , compared to the <unk> , where each <unk> is reconstructed independently .

naive bayes -lrb- nb -rrb- is well-known to be a simple but effective <unk> , especially when combined with <unk> . unfortunately , <unk> are often greedy and thus can not guarantee an optimal feature set is selected . an alternative to <unk> is to use <unk> averaging -lrb- <unk> -rrb- , which computes a weighted average over multiple predictors ; when the different <unk> correspond to different feature sets , <unk> has the advantage over <unk> that its predictions tend to have lower variance on average in comparison to any single model . in this paper , we show for the first time that <unk> is possible to exactly evaluate <unk> over the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in linear-time in the number of <unk> ; this yields an algorithm about as expensive to train as a single <unk> with all <unk> , but yet provably converges to the <unk> in the <unk> . we evaluate this novel <unk> on a range of datasets showing that <unk> never <unk> nb -lrb- as expected -rrb- and sometimes offers performance competitive -lrb- or superior -rrb- to <unk> such as <unk> and logistic regression while taking a fraction of the time to train .

voice morphing is a technique for modifying a source speaker 's speech to sound as if <unk> was spoken by some designated target speaker . most of the recent approaches to <unk> apply a <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> to modify the <unk> . whilst these methods are effective , they also introduce artifacts arising from the effects of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> . a practical <unk> must account for these if high <unk> is to be preserved . this paper describes a complete <unk> and the enhancements needed for dealing with the various artifacts , including a novel method for synthesising <unk> . each technique is assessed individually and the overall performance of the <unk> evaluated using <unk> . overall <unk> is found that the enhancements significantly improve <unk> and <unk> .

this work addresses the problem of developing a <unk> for a <unk> given labeled data from several training domains where the <unk> is not necessarily present in <unk> . the <unk> accepts or rejects the <unk> based on the confidence generated by the <unk> . in the proposed approach , <unk> is grouped into <unk> and separate <unk> are trained . one of the main findings is that the <unk> and the <unk> of the clusters are not very high which suggests that the domains might not necessarily be <unk> . the performance of these <unk> is better than that of : -lrb- a -rrb- a single <unk> trained on data from all the domains , and -lrb- b -rrb- a set of <unk> trained separately for each of the training domains . at an operating point corresponding to low false accept , the correct accept of the proposed technique is on an average 2.3 % higher than that obtained by the <unk> or the individual <unk> <unk> .

a common approach in <unk> is the use of <unk> as <unk> . in this paper , <unk> are compared in order to explore the balancing between data availability and an improved <unk> for <unk> . a technique for <unk> is described and it is compared to the <unk> described in <unk> . both objective and subjective testing indicated that a phoneme-based approach leads to better synthesis results . in addition , the test results improve when more different <unk> are defined . this raises some questions on the widely applied <unk> approach . it appears that a <unk> is not capable of describing all subtle details of the <unk> . in addition , with <unk> the <unk> is affected by the loss of <unk> in the <unk> .

a fundamental issue in <unk> is the compromise between the flexibility of the <unk> for <unk> and the ability of recovering the motion . <unk> , e.g. , <unk> , may enable the <unk> , but it does not tolerate much <unk> . on the other hand , <unk> , e.g. , <unk> , can accommodate <unk> , but may be blind to some <unk> , e.g. , <unk> and <unk> . this paper presents a novel <unk> that integrates the advantages of both in a principled way based on a <unk> that combines <unk> and <unk> . this <unk> can capture a large variety of <unk> that are attributed to the <unk> . at the same time , this <unk> enables efficient <unk> . a <unk> is defined and rigorous analytical results are obtained that lead to a <unk> to <unk> . very encouraging results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed <unk> for <unk> that exhibit <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .

we describe an <unk> for <unk> defined on <unk> , of the type usually encountered in problems involving <unk> . such <unk> are often minimized using <unk> , but this <unk> is only applicable to <unk> . in this paper , we describe an <unk> that will solve any <unk> , irrespective of whether it is <unk> or not , and for <unk> we use <unk> . the <unk> is based on the <unk> , which eliminates <unk> from the <unk> until the remaining function is <unk> . it can then be solved using <unk> . values of <unk> are recovered using <unk> . we compare the <unk> 's performance against alternative methods for solving <unk> , with favourable results .

in this paper , we propose a <unk> , which learns a <unk> by minimizing an <unk> over the <unk> induced from a <unk> . by interpreting the <unk> as <unk> in an <unk> , we show the proposed <unk> converges to a solution within <unk> of that using an exact <unk> , by drawing o -lrb- 1 / <unk> -rrb- random features , in contrast to the <unk> achieved by current monte-carlo analyses of <unk> . in our experiments , the <unk> obtains a sparse solution that requires less <unk> , while maintaining comparable performance on <unk> . moreover , as an <unk> for the <unk> , the <unk> also enjoys better convergence guarantees than a <unk> in the setting where the <unk> can not be performed exactly .

in this paper we address the issue of output instability of <unk> : <unk> in the <unk> can significantly distort the <unk> and output of a <unk> . such instability affects many <unk> with state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of <unk> . we present a <unk> to stabilize <unk> against <unk> that result from various types of <unk> , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . we validate our method by stabilizing the state-of-the-art <unk> -lsb- 11 -rsb- against these types of distortions . in addition , we demonstrate that our stabilized model gives robust state-of-the-art performance on <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> on <unk> .

one of the main challenges in learning <unk> is gathering training images . recent work in <unk> circumvents this challenge by describing categories via attributes or text . however , not all <unk> , e.g. , two people dancing , are easily amenable to such descriptions . in this paper , we propose a new <unk> for <unk> using <unk> to learn <unk> . specifically , we explore <unk> related to people and their interactions with others . our proposed <unk> allows one to provide <unk> by manipulating <unk> , e.g. , one can illustrate interactions between two <unk> people by manipulating each person 's pose , expression , <unk> , and gender . the feasibility of our <unk> is shown on a <unk> and a new dataset containing complex interactions between two people , where we outperform several baselines . to better match across the two domains , we learn an explicit mapping between the abstract and real worlds .

in recent years , <unk> have gained a lot of prominence for <unk> complex <unk> because of their capability to incorporate complex variations in data within the model . however , these models often need to be trained for a long time in order to obtain good results . in this paper , we propose a technique , called ` <unk> ' , that allows the same models to perform considerably better with very little training . we show that <unk> can be done tractably , even when the <unk> is stretched to infinity , for some specific models . we also study <unk> for implementing <unk> in <unk> in an <unk> and derive bounds for its convergence . our experimental results suggest that the proposed <unk> are capable of achieving good performance for many <unk> . more importantly , for a <unk> , one can achieve much better <unk> using <unk> rather than <unk> the weights using <unk> .

a novel method for determining the set of parameters for a <unk> of a time series is proposed . based upon the <unk> , both the <unk> , and <unk> , are simultaneously determined . the choice of these parameters is closely related to the length of the optimal tap input delay line of an <unk> or <unk> . the method employs a single criterion -- the '' entropy ratio '' between the <unk> of a signal and an ensemble of its surrogates -- and is first systematically tested on <unk> for which the optimal <unk> are known , after which it is verified on a number of benchmark real-world time series . the proposed entropy ratio method is shown to consistently outperform some well-established methods .

most methods for <unk> are based on the <unk> , which takes a <unk> called the <unk> . in most previous analyses the <unk> was carefully tuned to obtain optimal worst-case performance , leading to suboptimal performance on easy instances , for example when there exists an action that is significantly better than all others . we propose a new way of setting the <unk> , which adapts to the difficulty of the <unk> : in the worst case our procedure still guarantees optimal performance , but on easy instances it achieves much smaller regret . in particular , our adaptive method achieves constant regret in a <unk> , when there exists an action that on average obtains strictly smaller loss than all other actions . we also provide a <unk> comparing our approach to existing methods .

this paper presents a new approach for estimating voice source and vocal tract filter characteristics of <unk> . when it is required to know the <unk> of a system in <unk> , the input and output of the system are experimentally observed and used to calculate the function . however , in the case of <unk> we deal with in this paper , only the output -lrb- speech -rrb- is observed and the characteristics of the system -lrb- vocal tract -rrb- and the input -lrb- voice source -rrb- must simultaneously be estimated . hence the estimate becomes extremely difficult , and it is usually solved approximately using <unk> . we demonstrate that these characteristics are separable under the assumption that they are independently controlled by different factors . the separation is realised using an <unk> along with the <unk> , which we have proposed to find spectral envelopes of <unk> with minimum interference of the <unk> .

this paper addresses the problem of <unk> from a sequence of <unk> . <unk> occurring in both time and spectrum is important in <unk> . we present a methodology for the <unk> such as moving objects and their <unk> from <unk> . the <unk> are obtained by using a coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging -lrb- <unk> -rrb- system . the <unk> encodes a <unk> containing both <unk> and <unk> in a single <unk> . in the proposed methodology , we use the <unk> as columns of a large data matrix g g g. <unk> is then used to decompose <unk> into the <unk> and a <unk> capturing the anomalies in the foreground . the <unk> is then used jointly with <unk> to recover the <unk> of the objects of interest . an example for the <unk> in a <unk> -lrb- rgb -rrb- is presented .

we consider the problem of <unk> using <unk> through the minimization of an <unk> involving both <unk> . these <unk> are derived through a <unk> instead of <unk> . the <unk> can be elegantly derived without converting the <unk> into boundary integrals . from the <unk> , we deduce the <unk> of an <unk> that makes it evolve towards a minimum of the criterion . we focus more particularly on <unk> globally attached to the region and especially to the probability density functions of <unk> such as the <unk> of a region . a <unk> is set for the <unk> between two <unk> for matching or tracking purposes . an application of this <unk> to the <unk> in <unk> is then proposed . we briefly describe our <unk> and show some experimental results .

a key challenge in <unk> is the <unk> that are able to learn while acting in the presence of other agents that are simultaneously learning and adapting . these domains require <unk> without the benefit of repeated training examples , as well as the ability to adapt to the evolving behavior of other agents in the environment . the difficulty is further exacerbated when the agents are in an <unk> , demanding that a robust -lrb- i.e. winning -rrb- <unk> be rapidly learned and adapted . we propose an <unk> , <unk> , based on a straightforward <unk> that is able to rapidly learn and adapt to <unk> . we demonstrate the performance of this <unk> in a non-stationary learning environment of <unk> .

our understanding of the <unk> has been substantially advanced by <unk> . the large number of parameters needing <unk> in these <unk> has , however , somewhat hampered their applicability and <unk> . here we propose a simple and well-founded method for <unk> of many of these key parameters : 1 -rrb- the <unk> on the cell 's membrane ; 2 -rrb- the <unk> ; 3 -rrb- the channels ' <unk> ; 4 -rrb- the <unk> ; and 5 -rrb- the <unk> in each <unk> . we assume experimental access to : a -rrb- the <unk> in the dendrite -lrb- or some contiguous <unk> thereof , e.g. via <unk> -rrb- , b -rrb- an approximate kinetic description of the channels and synapses present in each <unk> , and c -rrb- the morphology of the part of the neuron under investigation . the key observation is that , given data a -rrb- - c -rrb- , all of the parameters 1 -rrb- -4 -rrb- may be simultaneously inferred by a version of <unk> ; this <unk> , in turn , is efficiently solved using standard algorithms , without any '' local minima '' problems despite the large number of parameters and complex dynamics . the <unk> may also be estimated by standard techniques . we demonstrate the method 's <unk> on several <unk> , and describe techniques for quantifying the uncertainty in our estimates .

we propose two approaches for improving the <unk> for the <unk> in <unk> . the <unk> used in <unk> are often constructed with an <unk> with <unk> and the <unk> is always employed in the <unk> training of <unk> . the pairing of <unk> and <unk> contributes much in the success of <unk> . the first approach developed in this paper improves the <unk> by boosting the importance of the frames for which the <unk> has low target predictions -lrb- low target posterior probabilities -rrb- and the second one considers jointly minimizing the cross-entropy and maximizing the <unk> between the target senone -lrb- <unk> states -rrb- and the most competing one . experiments on <unk> demonstrate that the two proposed methods can provide 3.1 % and 1.5 % <unk> , respectively , against the already very strong conventional <unk> .

in <unk> relying on the <unk> , <unk> generally produce better evaluations . theoretical analyses , however , suggest that in many cases <unk> amplifies the <unk> introduced by the <unk> used to evaluate the leaves of the <unk> , leading to what is known as <unk> , where <unk> produce worse evaluations . in most of the previous research , positions were evaluated as losses or wins . dependence between the values of positions close to each other was identified as the property of realistic <unk> that eliminates the <unk> and explains why <unk> is successful in practice . in this paper we present an alternative explanation that does not rely on <unk> . we show that if real numbers are used for <unk> , <unk> tend to be further apart at lower levels of the <unk> , which leads to a larger proportion of more extreme positions , where error is less probable . decreased probability of error in searches to greater depths is sufficient to eliminate the <unk> and no additional properties of <unk> are required .

in this paper we propose a class of efficient <unk> for computing parameters of the <unk> , where the data consists of <unk> over alternatives . our <unk> is based on breaking the <unk> into <unk> , and then computing parameters that satisfy a set of <unk> . we identify conditions for the output of <unk> to be unique , and identify a general class of <unk> . we then show by theory and experiments that our <unk> run significantly faster than the <unk> , while achieving competitive <unk> .

the majority of the existing algorithms for <unk> are greedy -- a <unk> is induced top-down , making locally optimal decisions at each node . in most cases , however , the <unk> is not globally optimal . furthermore , the <unk> require a fixed amount of time and are not able to generate a better <unk> if additional time is available . to overcome this problem , we present two <unk> for <unk> , thus allowing tradeoff between <unk> and <unk> . the first one is <unk> , where a larger <unk> permits larger k . the second algorithm uses a novel strategy for evaluating candidate splits ; a <unk> of <unk> is repeatedly invoked to estimate the size of the <unk> in which each split results , and the one that minimizes the expected size is preferred . experimental results indicate that for several hard concepts , our proposed approach exhibits good anytime behavior and yields significantly better <unk> when more time is available .

the <unk> <unk> -lrb- 0 < p < 1 -rrb- is usually used to replace the standard <unk> in order to approximate the <unk> more accurately . however , existing <unk> involve <unk> or <unk> in each iteration , and thus may become very slow and impractical for <unk> . in this paper , we first define two <unk> , i.e. , the <unk> , and then prove that <unk> are in essence the <unk> / 3 and 1/2 <unk> , respectively , which lead to the design of very efficient algorithms that only need to update two much smaller <unk> . we also design two efficient proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithms for solving <unk> . finally , we provide the <unk> and performance guarantees for our algorithms , which have better convergence properties than existing algorithms . experimental results on <unk> show that our algorithms are more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods , and are orders of magnitude faster .

data-driven grapheme-to-phoneme conversion involves either <unk> or -lrb- bottom-up -rrb- pronunciation by analogy . as both approaches rely on <unk> , they typically require some <unk> , e.g. , individual <unk> correspondences . to avoid such <unk> , this paper proposes an alternative solution , dubbed pronunciation by <unk> , which adopts a more <unk> . for each <unk> , a neighborhood of <unk> is constructed through an appropriate <unk> of its <unk> . <unk> then proceeds via <unk> and <unk> . this method was successfully applied to the <unk> with a large diversity of origin .

we present an approach to <unk> on standard hardware by <unk> . using an arbitrary partition of the <unk> into <unk> , the <unk> to the <unk> is obtained by iteratively combining <unk> which can be efficiently computed in parallel by separate <unk> for each <unk> . the approach is particularly suited for implementations on <unk> because <unk> between subdomains -lrb- i.e. processors -rrb- is minimized by restricting the exchange of data to a <unk> . by applying a <unk> , the necessary number of <unk> between subdomains to achieve a fixed error is bounded independently of the number of subdomains . our approach provides a major step towards <unk> using off-the-shelf <unk> and facilitates the efficient application of <unk> to <unk> .

precision-recall analysis <unk> in applications of <unk> where true negatives do not add value and hence should not affect assessment of the <unk> 's performance . perhaps inspired by the many advantages of <unk> and the area under such curves for <unk> , many researchers have taken to report <unk> and associated areas as <unk> . we demonstrate in this paper that this practice is <unk> with difficulties , mainly because of <unk> -- e.g. , the area under a <unk> takes the <unk> whereas the <unk> applies the harmonic mean . we show how to fix this by plotting <unk> in a different <unk> , and demonstrate that the new <unk> inherit all key advantages of <unk> . in particular , the area under <unk> conveys an expected f 1 score on a <unk> , and the <unk> of a <unk> allows us to calibrate the <unk> 's scores so as to determine , for each operating point on the <unk> , the <unk> for which the point optimises <unk> . we demonstrate experimentally that the area under traditional <unk> can easily favour models with lower expected f 1 score than others , and so the use of <unk> will result in better <unk> .

sparse <unk> has been demonstrated to be effective in handling <unk> . while promising , most of the existing works use <unk> , which may be suboptimal in terms of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> . in this paper , we expand a <unk> to <unk> , which is motivated by applications that require identifying the underlying group structure and performing <unk> simultaneously . the main contributions of this article are twofold : -lrb- 1 -rrb- statistically , we introduce a <unk> which can reconstruct the <unk> . therefore , consistent <unk> and <unk> can be achieved ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- computationally , we propose an efficient algorithm that is applicable to <unk> . numerical results suggest that the proposed <unk> compares favorably against its competitors on <unk> and <unk> , thus achieving desired goal of delivering high performance .

1 this paper presents an analysis of <unk> produced under different types and levels of <unk> . the speech used for the analysis forms a part of the <unk> and consists of sentences from the well-known <unk> , spoken in the presence of highway , large crowd and pink <unk> . differences are shown to exist in the <unk> under these varying <unk> . the deterioration of the <unk> of an <unk> trained on neutral and tested with <unk> is also illustrated . a clear <unk> between the effect of <unk> and lombard effect on <unk> is also given by testing with <unk> . the effect of <unk> on system performance under the <unk> is addressed . it is seen that test duration has no effect on the <unk> under lombard effect . the average <unk> for <unk> test duration is 14 .

atypical speech prosody is a primary characteristic of <unk> , yet <unk> is often excluded from <unk> due to poor subjective reliability . robust , objective prosodic cues can enhance our understanding of those aspects which are atypical in autism . in this work , we connect objective signal-derived descriptors of prosody to <unk> . subjectively , more <unk> is less expressive -lrb- more monotone -rrb- and more often has <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . we also find <unk> can be quantified through <unk> , and that <unk> and <unk> are highly predictive of <unk> . <unk> are also able to significantly differentiate subjects with <unk> from typically developing -lrb- td -rrb- subjects in a <unk> , emphasizing the potential of <unk> for <unk> and <unk> .

we investigate the problem of reducing the <unk> of a <unk> -lrb- <unk> , p <unk> -rrb- by finding a <unk> , chosen from a class of <unk> , such that h is optimal with respect to <unk> . we do this by first defining a <unk> for <unk> , which is closely related to the <unk> for <unk> . we then give an algorithm which uses this <unk> to compute the optimal h ∈ h. <unk> -lsb- 2 -rsb- and <unk> -lsb- 3 -rsb- have used <unk> to solve several <unk> when the size of the <unk> in the <unk> is bounded . we present an extension of this technique which applies to some important choices of h even when the size of the <unk> of <unk> are arbitrarily large . in particular , this applies to problems such as finding an optimal <unk> over a -lrb- k − 1 -rrb- - <unk> of a <unk> over a <unk> -lrb- for arbitrary k -rrb- and selecting an optimal <unk> with -lrb- a constant -rrb- d fewer edges with respect to <unk> can be solved in time polynomial in | v -lrb- <unk> -rrb- | using this formulation .

the paper addresses <unk> for <unk> by fully exploiting <unk> used in the lecture . as the text in the presentation slides is small in its size and <unk> in its content , a <unk> is addressed by focusing on the <unk> . several methods are investigated and combined ; first , <unk> is conducted based on <unk> -rrb- using <unk> appearing in all slides . <unk> is also retrieved to enhance the relevant text . then , <unk> of the <unk> are reflected with a <unk> by referring to the slide used during each utterance . experimental evaluations on <unk> show that the proposed method combining the <unk> achieves a significant improvement of <unk> , especially in the <unk> .

we present a new <unk> transform approach to <unk> using gaussian mixture density hidden markov models -lrb- <unk> -rrb- for <unk> . the feature transform is formulated with a set of <unk> utilizing both <unk> and <unk> . the <unk> are estimated by <unk> using <unk> , while the <unk> are trained by conventional <unk> . compared with two baseline systems , which use <unk> with either <unk> or <unk> only and are trained using the conventional <unk> for both <unk> and <unk> , the proposed approach achieves a <unk> of 10 % and 6 % respectively on <unk> .

this paper presents a <unk> for training <unk> using the <unk> . <unk> has been recently proposed as a robust similarity measure between two <unk> or signals , when the <unk> involved are heavy tailed and <unk> . maximizing the <unk> between the output of an <unk> and the desired response leads to the <unk> for <unk> . we show that a <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> using this <unk> yields a simple <unk> like formulation . our simulations show that training the <unk> using this <unk> is much faster than <unk> , and more accurate than the <unk> in cases where the <unk> is <unk> and heavy tailed .

we resolve a <unk> old open question in <unk> : how many pursuers are needed to capture an evader in an <unk> with obstacles ? the evader is assumed to be adversarial , moves with the same <unk> as pursuers , and is '' sensed '' by a <unk> only when it lies in line-of-sight of that <unk> . the players move in <unk> , and the capture occurs when a <unk> reaches the position of the evader on its move . our main result is that o -lrb- √ h + log n -rrb- pursuers can always win the game with a <unk> in any polygon with n vertices and h obstacles -lrb- holes -rrb- . in order to achieve this bound , however , we argue that the environment must satisfy a <unk> , which essentially requires the <unk> between any two vertices to be of the same order as the speed of the players . without the <unk> , we show that ω -lrb- n / log n -rrb- pursuers are needed in the worst-case even for <unk> ! this reveals an unexpected <unk> that seems to have been overlooked in previous work <unk> that <unk> can always win in <unk> . our lower bound also shows that capturing an evader is inherently more difficult than just '' seeing '' it because <unk> are prov-ably sufficient for <unk> even against an arbitrarily fast evader in simple <unk> .

sponsored search is an important <unk> for <unk> , in which an <unk> is used to select the ads shown to users and determine the prices charged from advertisers . there have been several pieces of work in the literature that investigate how to design an <unk> in order to optimize the revenue of the <unk> . however , due to some unrealistic assumptions used , the practical values of these studies are not very clear . in this paper , we propose a novel <unk> , which naturally combines <unk> and <unk> , and learns the <unk> using a <unk> . in particular , we first learn a <unk> from <unk> to describe how advertisers change their bids in response to an <unk> , and then for any given <unk> , we use the learnt <unk> to predict its corresponding future bid sequences . next we learn the <unk> through <unk> on the <unk> . we show that the empirical revenue will converge when the <unk> approaches infinity , and a <unk> can effectively optimize this empirical revenue . our experiments indicate that the proposed <unk> is able to produce a much more effective <unk> than several baselines .

a <unk> defines the behavior of an agent by combining <unk> , <unk> and <unk> that make explicit reference to the <unk> . in this paper we consider a setting where an agent is equipped with a <unk> providing <unk> and an incomplete description of the initial situation . we introduce a corresponding new <unk> that allows for representing both <unk> , and that we then use to build <unk> with <unk> expressed in the <unk> . after proving undecidability for the general case , we then discuss a <unk> where <unk> becomes decidable . the provided proof is constructive and comes with an upper bound on the <unk> .

efficient <unk> with <unk> is often based on extracting <unk> from the data that '' <unk> '' the kernel . while most constructions aim at obtaining <unk> , in this work we explore <unk> . we give a method to compute <unk> for <unk> , <unk> as a special case a popular map for the <unk> and extending it to <unk> . we show that <unk> can handle efficiently these <unk> in <unk> . as an application , we show that <unk> can be interpreted as a <unk> , and use this to significantly accelerate <unk> with this technique . we demonstrate these ideas on <unk> with <unk> and <unk> with <unk> on the challenging <unk> , obtaining five to tenfold speed-ups as well as reducing <unk> by an order of magnitude .

examples are often used along with <unk> to help convey particular <unk> in <unk> . these accompanying examples reflect information in the surrounding text , and in turn , also influence the text . sometimes , examples replace possible -lrb- textual -rrb- <unk> in the description . it is thus clear that if <unk> are to be generated , the system must incorporate strategies to handle examples . in this work , we shall investigate some of these issues in the generation of <unk> .

in applications of <unk> where <unk> is of primary interest , it is necessary to accurately characterize the <unk> over <unk> . this paper proposes an adaptation of the <unk> to draw samples from the <unk> over <unk> with <unk> and without the need to compute the <unk> . in <unk> , this has the enormous advantage that <unk> can be computed by solving <unk> only . a novel <unk> based on <unk> is developed to accelerate the <unk> . the results demonstrate the possibility to enable scal-able and exact -lrb- in a monte carlo sense -rrb- <unk> of uncertainty in <unk> without imposing any special structure on the <unk> or reducing the number of input vectors .

automated musical accompaniment of human performers often requires an agent be able to follow a musical score with similar facility to that of a <unk> . systems described in the literature represent musical scores in a way that assumes no <unk> of the piece during performance . if the performer deviates from the expected path by skipping or repeating a section , the system may become lost . we describe a way to automatically generate a <unk> from a <unk> that models the <unk> , and an <unk> to align a performance to a score . the resulting system can follow performances that take alternate paths through the score without losing its place . we compare the performance of our system to that of <unk> on a <unk> . results show that explicitly representing the <unk> of a score significantly improves score following when the branch a performer may take is unknown beforehand .

we present in this paper a novel approach for training <unk> . we show that by adding a well chosen penalty term to the <unk> , we can achieve results that equal or surpass those attained by other <unk> as well as <unk> on a range of datasets . this penalty term corresponds to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> with respect to the input . we show that this penalty term results in a <unk> which in turn yields robust <unk> on the <unk> . furthermore , we show how this penalty term is related to both <unk> and <unk> and how it can be seen as a link between <unk> . we find empirically that this penalty helps to <unk> a representation that better captures the <unk> dictated by the data , corresponding to a <unk> , while being more invariant to the vast majority of directions orthogonal to the <unk> . finally , we show that by using the learned <unk> to initialize a <unk> , we achieve state of the art classification error on a range of datasets , surpassing other methods of <unk> .

matrix factorization techniques have been frequently applied in <unk> . among them , <unk> have received considerable attentions due to its psychological and physiological interpretation of naturally occurring data whose representation may be parts-based in <unk> . on the other hand , from <unk> the data is usually sampled from a <unk> embedded in <unk> . one hopes then to find a <unk> which uncovers the <unk> and simultaneously respects the <unk> . in this paper , we propose a novel algorithm , called locality preserving non-negative matrix factorization -lrb- <unk> -rrb- , for this purpose . for two data points , we use <unk> to evaluate their similarity on the <unk> . the optimal maps are obtained such that the <unk> on <unk> are restricted to be non-negative and vary smoothly along the <unk> . our empirical study shows the encouraging results of the proposed algorithm in comparisons to the state-of-the-art algorithms on two large <unk> .

kernel functions have become an extremely popular tool in <unk> , with an attractive theory as well . this theory views a kernel as implicitly mapping data points into a possibly very high dimensional space , and describes a <unk> as being good for a given <unk> if data is separable by a large margin in that <unk> . however , while quite elegant , this theory does not directly correspond to one 's intuition of a good kernel as a good <unk> . furthermore , it may be difficult for a domain expert to use the theory to help design an appropriate kernel for the <unk> at hand since the <unk> may not be easy to calculate . finally , the requirement of <unk> may rule out the most <unk> for the given problem <unk> this work we develop an alternative , more general theory of learning with <unk> -lrb- i.e. , sufficient conditions for a <unk> to allow one to learn well -rrb- that does not require reference to <unk> , and does not require the function to be positive semi-definite -lrb- or even symmetric -rrb- . our results also generalize the standard theory in the sense that any good <unk> under the usual definition can be shown to also be a good <unk> under our definition -lrb- though with some loss in the parameters -rrb- . in this way , we provide the first steps towards a <unk> that describes the effectiveness of a given <unk> in terms of <unk> .

we describe an approach to <unk> with <unk> , which have been shown to be highly effective for <unk> . our approach is based on a <unk> recently introduced for spectral estimation of <unk> coupled with a <unk> well-known in the <unk> . we also describe an error bound for this approximation , which gives guarantees showing that if the underlying tensors are well approximated , then the <unk> will also be well approximated . empirical evaluation on <unk> demonstrates a significant speed-up at minimal cost for <unk> performance .

recently , the <unk> has been proposed and found to be a useful source of <unk> . the <unk> represents longer term variations in the spectrum and thus implicitly requires <unk> extracted from much longer speech segments compared to <unk> and their delta terms . in this paper , a <unk> of the <unk> combined with a discrete cosine series -lrb- <unk> -rrb- expansion of dct coefficients over time is proposed as a method for capturing both the <unk> . these <unk> can be computed so as to emphasize <unk> or <unk> or a combination of the two factors . several variations of the <unk> were evaluated with <unk> experiments using <unk> and its telephone version -lrb- <unk> -rrb- . best results obtained with a combined feature set are <unk> % for <unk> and <unk> % for <unk> . the <unk> are shown to be far more important than the <unk> for <unk> and far more noise robust .

model learning and <unk> are two important topics in <unk> . while there are many applications where one of them is used to support the other , there are currently only few where both aid each other simultaneously . in this work , we seek to incrementally learn a <unk> from <unk> and to simultaneously use whatever has been learned to improve the <unk> in the next frames . the main problem encountered in this situation is that the current <unk> may be inconsistent with future observations , creating a bias in the <unk> results . we propose an uncertain model that explicitly accounts for such uncertainties by representing relations by an appropriately weighted sum of informative -lrb- parametric -rrb- and <unk> . the method is completely unsupervised and operates in real time .

3d object reconstruction from a single <unk> is an important problem in both <unk> and graphics . many methods have been put forward to solve this problem , but they usually fail when the <unk> of a <unk> becomes complex . in this paper , a novel approach based on a <unk> is proposed to handle <unk> from <unk> . the approach consists of three steps : 1 -rrb- dividing a complex <unk> into multiple simpler line drawings based on the result of <unk> ; 2 -rrb- reconstructing the <unk> from these simpler line drawings ; and 3 -rrb- merging the <unk> into one complete object represented by the original <unk> . a number of examples are given to show that our approach can handle <unk> than previous methods .

motion information is essential in many <unk> and <unk> . since <unk> is still one of the most prevalent formats for representing , transferring and storing video data , the analysis of its motion field is important for real time video indexing and segmentation , <unk> and <unk> . our work considers the problem of improving the <unk> in <unk> . we address the issues of robust , incremental , dense optical flow estimation by combining information from two different <unk> : the available <unk> and the one inferred by a <unk> applied on the <unk> . thus , the <unk> is based only on information that is directly available in the <unk> avoiding therefore the time and <unk> . we extend standard techniques by adding a <unk> and an <unk> , both as <unk> in the <unk> and as hypothesis tests for the presence of <unk> . our approach is shown to perform well over a range of different <unk> and can serve as a basis for efficient <unk> .

this paper considers a method for learning a <unk> in a <unk> which identifies a <unk> by measuring the distance between its fingerprint and a fingerprint stored in a database . a metric having a general form of the <unk> is learned with the goal that the distance between fingerprints extracted from perceptually similar contents should be smaller than the distance between fingerprints extracted from perceptually dissimilar contents . the metric is learned by minimizing a <unk> designed to achieve the goal . the <unk> is convex , and the <unk> can be obtained using <unk> . in our experiment , the <unk> is applied in an <unk> , and it is experimentally shown that the learned <unk> improves the <unk> performance .

efficient learning equilibrium -lrb- <unk> -rrb- is a <unk> for <unk> with <unk> . it requires the <unk> themselves to be in equilibrium for any game selected from a set of -lrb- initially unknown -rrb- games . in an optimal <unk> , the <unk> would efficiently obtain the surplus the agents would obtain in an optimal nash equilibrium of the initially unknown game which is played . the crucial part is that in an <unk> from the <unk> would become <unk> after <unk> , although the game played is initially unknown . while appealing conceptually , the main challenge for establishing <unk> based on this concept is to isolate general classes of games where an <unk> exists . unfortunately , it has been shown that while an <unk> exists for the setting in which each agent can observe all other agents ' actions and payoffs , an <unk> does not exist in general when the other agents ' payoffs can not be observed . in this paper we provide the first positive results on this problem , <unk> proving the existence of an optimal <unk> for the class of symmetric games where an agent can not observe other agents ' payoffs .

forced alignment for <unk> traditionally aligns a <unk> predetermined by the <unk> . this sequence is not altered during alignment , i.e. , it is forced , despite possibly being faulty . the <unk> is the assumption that these mistakes do not degrade models , as long as the mistakes are consistent across training and synthesis . we present evidence that in the alignment of both standard <unk> and <unk> this <unk> is often wrong , and that this is likely to have a negative impact on <unk> . a <unk> allowing for <unk> is implemented , resulting in improved <unk> for both types of speech . a perceptual evaluation of <unk> showed that <unk> trained on this improved alignment also improved standard synthesis , despite breaking the <unk> .

full covariance acoustic models trained with <unk> generalize poorly to <unk> due to a large number of <unk> . we propose to use <unk> to address this problem . previous <unk> never outperformed <unk> . we propose a method to automatically drive the structure of <unk> to sparse during training . we use a new <unk> by adding <unk> to the traditional <unk> for <unk> for the estimation of a <unk> is incorporated into the <unk> to learn parameters of <unk> using the new <unk> . experimental results show that we only need about 25 % of the parameters of the <unk> to be nonzero in order to achieve the same performance of a full covariance system . our proposed system using <unk> also significantly outperforms a system using <unk> trained on <unk> .

bounded confidence opinion dynamic models have received much recent interest as models of <unk> in <unk> and <unk> . however in the existing literature , opinions are only viewed as abstract quantities rather than as part of a <unk> . in this work , <unk> are examined when agents are <unk> that perform <unk> or <unk> . <unk> is defined on <unk> of hypotheses through <unk> , the appropriate measure between <unk> in <unk> . this definition contrasts with the measure used between opinions in the standard model : absolute error . it is shown that the rapid convergence of <unk> to a small number of <unk> is similar to that seen in the standard model . the most interesting finding in this work is that the number of these <unk> changes with the <unk> in the <unk> . the number of final values or <unk> is maximal at <unk> , suggesting that the most <unk> issues lead to the largest number of <unk> .

randomized features provide a computationally efficient way to approximate <unk> in <unk> . however , such methods require a <unk> as input . we extend the <unk> to the task of learning a kernel -lrb- via its associated <unk> -rrb- . specifically , we present an efficient <unk> that learns a kernel in a <unk> . we prove the consistency of the estimated kernel as well as <unk> for the <unk> induced by the optimized kernel , and we experimentally evaluate our technique on several datasets . our approach is efficient and highly scalable , and we attain competitive results with a fraction of the <unk> of other techniques .

spoken dialogue interfaces , mostly <unk> , become more visible in applications where attention needs to be shared with other tasks , such as driving a car . the deployment of the simple <unk> , instead of more sophisticated ones , is partly because the <unk> used for such tasks have been less powerful and partly because certain issues from these cognitively challenging tasks have not been well addressed even in the most advanced <unk> . this paper reports the progress of our research effort in developing a robust , wide-coverage , and cognitive <unk> spoken dialog interface called <unk> : <unk> for <unk> . our research in the past few years has led to promising results , including high <unk> , <unk> , and improved <unk> .

in practice , most <unk> is done assuming a <unk> of <unk> known as the <unk> . while often an acceptable approximation , the <unk> is not always valid empirically . this motivates a <unk> to <unk> , called <unk> , where the objective is to maximize wealth relative to the wealth <unk> by the best fixed portfolio in hindsight . in this paper we tie the two approaches , and design an <unk> which is universal in the worst-case , and yet capable of exploiting the mostly valid <unk> . our <unk> is based on new and improved <unk> for <unk> with <unk> .

this paper presents a formulation for <unk> reflecting multiple causal structure in <unk> . unlike the standard <unk> , a <unk> accounts for <unk> by combining assertions from many hidden causes , each of which can pertain to varying degree to any subset of the observable dimensions . a crucial issue is the <unk> for combining beliefs from different <unk> in order to generate <unk> whose errors are minimized both during <unk> and <unk> . we demonstrate a weakness inherent to the popular <unk> followed by <unk> , and offer an alternative form of the <unk> . results are presented demonstrating the algorithm 's ability successfully to discover coherent multiple causal <unk> of <unk> and in <unk> .

in this paper we introduce a new distance for robustly matching vectors of 3d rotations . a special representation of 3d rotations , which we coin <unk> quaternion -lrb- <unk> -rrb- , allows us to express this distance as <unk> . we apply the distance to the problems of <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in <unk> . for the former , we introduce a <unk> for scale and translation which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach on a <unk> . for the latter , we incorporate <unk> with the proposed <unk> to highlight the benefits of the new representation .

we propose a novel <unk> for <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . unlike commonly used bag-of-words approaches , the <unk> is exploited in our <unk> . the <unk> is used both to construct <unk> and to increase the discriminability of the description . each <unk> combines <unk> -rrb- with <unk> . compared with the state-of-the-art <unk> , the proposed <unk> has both higher <unk> for <unk> on the same object -rrb- and lower <unk> -lrb- <unk> -rrb- . the advantages of <unk> are most pronounced in the presence of <unk> and scale change , significant occlusion or small physical overlap of the viewing fields . we demonstrate the power of the proposed <unk> on <unk> in a large unordered collection of <unk> and on a <unk> .

most existing <unk> utilize a <unk> to represent a target , resulting in a high dimensional data learning problem . recently , <unk> is incorporated into the <unk> which offline constructs a <unk> using <unk> . this reduces <unk> substantially , whereas the <unk> is high . in this paper , we present an effective <unk> which models the appearance changes of a target by incrementally learning a <unk> through adaptively updating the sample mean and eigenbasis . <unk> then is led by the <unk> within the framework in which a <unk> is used for propagating sample distributions over the time . a novel <unk> , based on the <unk> , is developed to measure the similarity between the test image and the learned <unk> during the <unk> . <unk> and experimental evaluations against a state-of-the-art method demonstrate the promise and effectiveness of this <unk> .

we propose a <unk> for simultaneously refining the reconstructed volume of a human body with <unk> and identifying <unk> in it . <unk> , which are acquired by a slow but sophisticated <unk> , with <unk> are obtained offline . the <unk> are represented by trajectories in the eigenspaces using <unk> . an <unk> reconstructed online is projected into the <unk> and compared with the trajectories in order to find similar high-precision samples with <unk> . the <unk> taking into account 3d reconstruction errors can achieve robust and fast matching . experimental results demonstrate that our <unk> can refine the <unk> including <unk> and identify its <unk> in real time .

in this paper , a novel approach for <unk> using a <unk> is introduced . unlike previous studies in which <unk> and other <unk> were used for <unk> to obtain hard masks for each source , we use the <unk> to classify <unk> to check for their validity during separation . in the <unk> , the <unk> for the source signals are used to train a <unk> . in the <unk> , the trained <unk> is utilized to aid in estimation of each source in the mixed signal . <unk> is formulated as an <unk> where each source spectra estimate is encouraged to fit the trained <unk> and the <unk> is encouraged to be written as a weighted sum of the <unk> . the proposed approach works regardless of the <unk> between the source signals in the training and separation stages . <unk> is used to initialize the <unk> for each source . the experimental results show that using <unk> initialized by <unk> for <unk> improves the quality of the separated signal compared with using <unk> for <unk> .

for <unk> like <unk> , <unk> need to be taken when using <unk> to optimize their mechanisms -lrb- e.g. , auction -rrb- since <unk> in these applications may change their behaviors -lrb- and thus the <unk> -rrb- in response to the mechanisms . to tackle this problem , a framework called game-theoretic <unk> -lrb- <unk> -rrb- was recently proposed , which first learns a <unk> to characterize agents behaviors , and then learns the optimal <unk> by simulating agents ' behavior changes in response to the <unk> . while <unk> has demonstrated practical success , its <unk> is challenging because the <unk> are non-i.i.d. and dependent on the <unk> . to address this challenge , first , we decompose the <unk> for <unk> into the <unk> and the <unk> ; second , for the <unk> , we obtain novel <unk> for both <unk> ; third , for the <unk> , we derive a <unk> bound based on a new concept called nested covering number of the <unk> and the <unk> developed for mixing sequences .

this paper presents an <unk> that studies the emergence and evolution of a <unk> of <unk> , i.e. a vocabulary and a set of <unk> that allows the expression of <unk> . the <unk> assumes the agents have a common vocabulary for basic categories , the ability to construct <unk> using <unk> , and some general purpose cognitive capacities for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . but it does not assume the agents have a vocabulary for <unk> nor <unk> for expressing such <unk> through language . the results of the experiments we have performed show that a <unk> of <unk> emerges as a result of a process of <unk> of the individual agents ' interactions when these agents adapt their preferences for vocabulary and <unk> to those they observe are used more often by the rest of the population , and that such a <unk> is transmitted from one generation to the next .

in this paper , a <unk> <unk> for the <unk> is proposed . the proposed <unk> embeds both a <unk> and an <unk> using different <unk> depending on the bit . although the <unk> for the <unk> is complex , the performance of the <unk> using proposed <unk> with the <unk> against average attack is improved compared with the <unk> using <unk> . the <unk> using the proposed <unk> is robust against the <unk> whereas the <unk> using the <unk> is not .

story generation is <unk> a <unk> , despite disappointing preliminary results from the preceding three decades . one of the principle reasons for previous <unk> was the low level of <unk> , which resulted from the excessive focus of <unk> on <unk> . although these systems leveraged <unk> via <unk> , they failed to thoroughly extend those analyses to all relevant linguistic levels . the end result was narratives that were recognizable as stories , but whose <unk> was unsatisfactory . however , the <unk> for <unk> can not be laid <unk> at the feet of <unk> , as <unk> has to-date not fielded systems capable of faithfully reproducing either the variety or <unk> of naturally occurring stories . this paper presents the <unk> for accomplishing precisely that task , the <unk> implementation of a <unk> , and a brief description of a formal evaluation of the stories it produces .

two new approaches to <unk> in <unk> are proposed . each subarray is assumed to be well calibrated but the <unk> are assumed to remain unknown or imperfectly known . our first approach is based on a <unk> that , unlike the existing <unk> , exploits a <unk> for the <unk> . our second approach exploits the idea of estimating the <unk> by maximizing the output power of the <unk> . several modifications of our second approach are developed for the cases of <unk> .

a common assumption in <unk> is that the training and test samples are drawn from the same <unk> . however , there are many problems when this assumption is grossly violated , as in <unk> where different acquisitions can generate drastic variations in the appearance of the data due to changing experimental conditions . this <unk> is <unk> with <unk> , for which <unk> is very time-consuming , limiting the amount of data that can be labeled in new acquisitions for training . in this paper we present a <unk> for <unk> based on <unk> . unlike previous approaches that learn <unk> , our <unk> learns a single <unk> in a <unk> , common to all tasks . we use the <unk> to learn a <unk> of the observations in each task , with no need for specific a-priori knowledge of its <unk> . this yields a more <unk> that successfully leverages learning on new tasks where <unk> is scarce . we evaluate our <unk> on two challenging <unk> and achieve a significant improvement over the state of the art .

classification using <unk> is in general done by comparing the <unk> and choosing the class more likely to have generated the data . this work investigates a <unk> which additionally provides a probability for a <unk> and compares different <unk> . the notion is twofold : on the one hand applications in <unk> might pass their uncertainty of the <unk> to the next <unk> , on the other hand different streams might be fused to increase the performance . the data set studied incorporates two modalities and is based on a <unk> . the goal is to discriminate between laughter and utterances . it turned out that the <unk> out-performs <unk> using different <unk> while additionally providing a certainty about <unk> .

this paper presents several novel <unk> for the problem of <unk> based on a <unk> of the <unk> of the corresponding hypothesis sets . our bound for <unk> with a <unk> using l 1 regular-ization admits only a √ log p dependency on the number of kernels , which is tight and considerably more favorable than the previous best bound given for the same problem . we also give a novel bound for learning with a <unk> with an <unk> whose dependency on p is also tight and only in p 1/4 . we present similar results for l q regular-ization with other values of q , and outline the relevance of our proof techniques to the analysis of the <unk> of the class of linear functions . experiments with a large number of kernels further validate the behavior of the <unk> as a function of p predicted by our bounds .

for <unk> , a reasonable <unk> is crucial . in this paper , we present a <unk> for this task , where the resulting correlation with respect to each data encodes both its <unk> . specifically , this <unk> comprises two major modules : <unk> and <unk> . under the framework of <unk> , the <unk> introduces a set of <unk> to represent the <unk> of each feature-level basis , while the latter constructs the concept correlation of a specific data by combining its <unk> and <unk> together . in the end , given this new correlation , a <unk> is performed on <unk> . the experiments show that such a representation capturing <unk> could achieve better performance , than the <unk> applied to all data .

personalized <unk> systems recommend a list of tags to a user when he is about to annotate an item . it exploits the individual preference and the characteristic of the items . <unk> have been applied to many applications , such as <unk> . models based on <unk> can achieve good performance but require a lot of <unk> . on the other hand , models based on <unk> can run in <unk> and are more feasible for <unk> . in this paper , we propose a novel method for <unk> , which can be considered as a <unk> . different from <unk> , we exploit <unk> to increase the <unk> 's capacity . the experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for <unk> on <unk> and perform well even with a small number of <unk> , which verifies that our models can make better use of <unk> .

<unk> coding is a novel <unk> that utilizes the self-similarity of <unk> that include <unk> , in order to achieve <unk> . the key to a high compression ratio is replacing large image blocks with previously <unk> with similar structure . adjusting the lighting of the replaced block is critical for eliminating <unk> and increasing the number of matches . we propose a new <unk> that is based on the <unk> with <unk> . in order to fully exploit the benefits of the <unk> , we also propose modifications of the <unk> and <unk> . we show that the resulting <unk> achieves better coding performance .

one important class of <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> . the classical <unk> often fails to reliably learn the <unk> when there is <unk> , due to the large number of <unk> present in the model . in this paper , we propose a novel strategy for robustly and accurately learning the <unk> of the <unk> . the strategy is based on an <unk> for <unk> in which the learning of the <unk> is formulated as a <unk> in a <unk> . the resulting <unk> is called '' the <unk> . '' our preliminary experiment results on <unk> from speech show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the original <unk> on this task .

it has been previously demonstrated that systems based on <unk> and <unk> are suitable for <unk> due to the best trade-off in terms of <unk> , <unk> and performance . in this paper , we propose two methods to enhance the <unk> and performance of the <unk> . first , <unk> is performed to compensate the <unk> due to different <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc. . second , the difference between the <unk> and the maximum a <unk> is mapped into the <unk> whose <unk> becomes more incoherent . then , for verification purpose , the <unk> computed by <unk> with <unk> is employed to model these <unk> . experimental results show that the proposed system achieved 8.4 % -lrb- group 1 -rrb- and 10.5 % -lrb- group 2 -rrb- equal <unk> on the <unk> following the <unk> and outperformed the <unk> by yielding more than 20 % <unk> .

iterative methods that take steps in <unk> have proved to be useful for <unk> over <unk> . when the objective consists of a <unk> plus a <unk> , whose purpose is to induce structure -lrb- for example , spar-sity -rrb- in the solution , the solution often lies on a <unk> along which the regularizer is smooth . this paper shows that a <unk> can identify this <unk> with high probability . this observation motivates an <unk> in which , once a <unk> is identified , we switch to an <unk> that searches only in this <unk> , which typically has much lower <unk> than the <unk> , thus converging quickly to a <unk> with the desired structure . computational results are presented to illustrate these claims .

we propose a <unk> of the <unk> between two images with respect to an <unk> measuring <unk> and <unk> . to this end , we formulate the general <unk> as the search for a <unk> in r 4 . we then use tools from <unk> and introduce <unk> as a representation of <unk> in r 4 . we propose a discretization of this <unk> that gives rise to a <unk> and compute a <unk> using an efficient <unk> .

this paper presents a <unk> that handles <unk> by inferring both the <unk> that people pursue when speaking and the beliefs underlying these actions . we contend that recognizing the complex <unk> pursued in <unk> -lrb- e.g. , expressing doubt -rrb- requires both a <unk> and a <unk> that combines different <unk> in a unified framework . we show how our <unk> identifies the structure of <unk> , including recognizing <unk> , implicit acceptance of <unk> , and <unk> embedded within other <unk> . 1 introduction since <unk> is an integral part of <unk> , a <unk> must be able to handle <unk> in which participants negotiate what has been claimed in order to try to come to some agreement about those claims . to handle such dialogues , the <unk> must be able to recognize when a dialogue participant has initiated a <unk> <unk> and why the participant <unk> the <unk> -lrb- i.e. , what beliefs led the participant to start the <unk> -rrb- . this paper presents a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> by inferring both the <unk> that people pursue when speaking and the beliefs underlying these actions . we will argue that recognizing the complex <unk> pursued in <unk> -lrb- e.g. , expressing doubt -rrb- requires both a <unk> and a <unk> that combines different <unk> in a unified framework , and we will show how our <unk> incorporates these and recognizes the structure of <unk> .

effective reduction of <unk> in <unk> is rather challenging , especially for applications where <unk> rarely occur , such as <unk> . we develop an approach to prioritize <unk> by ranking them , and demonstrate its great effectiveness in reducing false positives while keeping good <unk> . our approach benefits from a novel representation of <unk> by <unk> , namely <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . the relative strengths of these <unk> are quantified using a <unk> -lsb- 19 -rsb- learnt on suitably designed <unk> of varying strengths are not only powerful in distinguishing <unk> from <unk> such as <unk> , but also computationally efficient for <unk> . with these <unk> , we apply a <unk> to sort <unk> according to their relevance to the end-user . we test the effectiveness of our approach on both <unk> and large ones collected from the real world .

we study the <unk> where arms are associated with <unk> and where rewards are therefore dependent : the question that arises from this setting is that of carefully recovering some independence by ` <unk> ' the values of some rewards . as we shall see , the <unk> we tackle requires us to address the <unk> , which we do by considering the idea of a <unk> in the new <unk> , a generalization of <unk> for the problem at hand , that we introduce . we provide a <unk> for this <unk> ; two noticeable features of <unk> are that i -rrb- <unk> reduces to the regular <unk> when the <unk> are all 0 , i.e. when the <unk> is recovered , and ii -rrb- when ϕ -lrb- n -rrb- = o -lrb- n − α -rrb- , <unk> is able to ensure a controlled regret of order θ ∆ -lrb- α − 2 -rrb- / α * log 1 / α t , where ∆ * encodes the distance between the best arm and the best <unk> , even in the case when α < 1 , i.e. the case when the <unk> are not <unk> .

permutation of the outputs at different <unk> remains as a major problem in the <unk> . in this work a <unk> effectively exploits the <unk> to mitigate such permutation . a <unk> for <unk> , which incorporates a <unk> within the <unk> in the <unk> , has been used . the proposed <unk> couples a number of conventional <unk> , equivalent to the number of outputs , by making <unk> in each model dependent not only on its own previous state , but also on some aspects of the state of the other models . using this <unk> the <unk> has been substantially reduced , and demonstrated using a number of <unk> .

the <unk> of the <unk> has been conventionally based on <unk> and describes thus only the average behavior of the <unk> . it has been shown previously that a <unk> can be regarded as a <unk> whose stability can be determined from the <unk> . generally , the <unk> can only be solved numerically and does not thus reveal the actual factors behind the dynamics of the <unk> . this paper derives an <unk> for the eigenvalues of the <unk> . the <unk> is easy to calculate , and <unk> also reveals the underlying reason for the bad convergence of the <unk> in some special cases . the <unk> is confirmed by comparing <unk> to the precise eigenvalues of the <unk> . the <unk> is found to be accurate for the eigenvalues close to unity .

a central challenge to many fields of <unk> involves minimizing <unk> over <unk> . gradient descent or <unk> are almost ubiquitously used to perform such minimizations , and it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these <unk> to find the <unk> is the proliferation of <unk> with much higher error than the <unk> . here we argue , based on results from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and empirical evidence , that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the <unk> , not <unk> , especially in <unk> . such <unk> are surrounded by high error <unk> that can dramatically slow down learning , and give the illusory impression of the existence of a <unk> . motivated by these arguments , we propose a new approach to <unk> , the <unk> newton method , that can rapidly escape <unk> , unlike <unk> and <unk> . we apply this algorithm to <unk> , and provide numerical evidence for its superior optimization performance .

ideally , kernels used to generate <unk> should be signal-dependent , and optimised independently at every location in the <unk> . this poses an extremely severe <unk> . a compromise is proposed in this paper : <unk> are optimised for specific <unk> in the <unk> . the <unk> , designed to isolate separate components comprising the signal , are determined by modelling the <unk> using a <unk> of <unk> . the parameters of the model are estimated using a combination of the <unk> and <unk> . the <unk> provides improved separation and resolution of <unk> when compared to methods using a solely time-varying kernel , without incurring an overwhelming <unk> .

the <unk> has been extensively studied in the field of <unk> . yet , the bulk of the existing work assumes that the scene contains only a single moving object . the more realistic case where an unknown number of objects move in the scene has received little attention , especially for its theoretical treatment . in this paper we present a new method for separating and recovering the motion and <unk> of multiple independently moving objects in a sequence of images . the method does not require prior knowledge of the number of objects , nor is dependent on any grouping of <unk> into an object at the <unk> . for this purpose , we introduce a <unk> , called the <unk> , which is invariant to both the <unk> and the <unk> . this <unk> is computable solely from the observed trajectories of <unk> without grouping them into individual objects . once the <unk> is computed , <unk> allows for <unk> into objects by the process of transforming <unk> into a <unk> , as well as recovering the <unk> and motion of each object .

in this paper , we propose a <unk> which tackles the <unk> in <unk> . the <unk> captures gradient statistics of canoni-cal patches over a <unk> whose parameters are optimized using training samples . we quantize the resulting <unk> using <unk> . the <unk> achieves about 95 % bits reduction compared with <unk> and allows adaptation of <unk> to support user required performance . moreover , accurate matching of <unk> with <unk> is allowed within several <unk> . we perform a comprehensive comparison with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> in the context of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . we achieve competing <unk> performance with <unk> , <unk> with much fewer bits . in particular , the <unk> outperforms <unk> at the same bits on eight data sets contributed to <unk> for <unk> .

frequency domain blind source separation -lrb- <unk> -rrb- is shown to be equivalent to two sets of <unk> , i.e. , <unk> . the minimization of the <unk> in the <unk> can be viewed as the minimization of the <unk> in the <unk> . the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> converge to the same solution in the <unk> if the two source signals are ideally independent . therefore , we can conclude that the performance of the <unk> is upper bounded by that of the <unk> . this understanding clearly explains the poor performance of the <unk> in a real room with long reverberation . the fundamental difference exists in the adaptation period when they should adapt . that is , the <unk> can adapt in the presence of a <unk> but the absence of a target , whereas the <unk> can adapt in the presence of a target and <unk> , and also in the presence of only a target .

lexicalized <unk> play a crucial role in <unk> . they are usually learned from the <unk> by examining the <unk> . instead of just checking whether there is one phrase adjacent to a given phrase , we argue that it is important to take the number of adjacent phrases into account for better estimations of <unk> . we propose to use a <unk> , which represents all <unk> of a sentence pair , to learn <unk> efficiently . experimental results on the <unk> show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline method .

dimensional sentiment analysis aims to recognize <unk> in multiple dimensions such as the <unk> . compared to the <unk> that focuses on <unk> such as <unk> -lrb- i.e. , positive and negative -rrb- , the <unk> can provide more <unk> . this study proposes a <unk> consisting of two parts : <unk> and <unk> to predict the <unk> . unlike a conventional <unk> which considers a whole text as input , the proposed <unk> uses an individual sentence as a region , dividing an input text into several regions such that the useful <unk> in each region can be extracted and weighted according to their contribution to the <unk> . such <unk> is sequentially integrated across regions using <unk> for <unk> . by combining the <unk> and <unk> , both <unk> within sentences and <unk> across sentences can be considered in the <unk> . experimental results show that the proposed <unk> outperforms lexicon-based , regression based , and <unk> proposed in previous studies .

in some <unk> we find conversations recorded simultaneously over multiple channels . that is the case of the interviews in the <unk> . to take advantage of that , we propose a modification of the <unk> that considers two different <unk> . the first term is tied between all the recordings belonging to the same conversation whereas the second is not . thus , the former mainly intends to capture the variability due to the <unk> of the conversation while the latter tries to capture the <unk> . we test this <unk> on the <unk> using multiple channels per interview to <unk> the speakers . the proposed <unk> improves the <unk> by 26 -- 29 % on <unk> and by 1 -- 8 % on interviews compared to the standard <unk> -lrb- scored by the book -rrb- .

in this paper , we present a method that combines the merits of <unk> , specifically <unk> , and <unk> in the context of <unk> . the proposed model employs a set of -lrb- theoretically -rrb- infinite interdependent <unk> as <unk> , that robustly capture <unk> . the employed <unk> are connected in the context of a <unk> that allows for capturing <unk> in the <unk> . appropriate <unk> are imposed over the <unk> of our model to allow for data-driven determination of the optimal number of <unk> , under a standard <unk> . <unk> is performed under the <unk> , which integrates the <unk> with <unk> . we evaluate our method using several <unk> , and compare it to state-of-the-art alternatives .

spoken term detection is a well-known <unk> that seeks to extract <unk> from <unk> by locating occurrences of <unk> . this paper describes a <unk> to such <unk> based on pattern matching of <unk> at the <unk> . the <unk> comprises the cascade of a segmental variant of <unk> and a <unk> to further improve <unk> to <unk> . this <unk> notably differs from more traditional <unk> that , while shown to be very accurate , rely upon the availability of large amounts of <unk> . we evaluate our <unk> on different <unk> of the <unk> : <unk> and <unk> , <unk> output by two different state of the art phoneme recog-nizers .

recently there has developed considerable interest in using sparse-ness with <unk> . almost all previous methods concentrate on <unk> out some <unk> . here we develop a new approach which zeros out whole variables automatically . we formulate a <unk> and optimize <unk> by steepest descent along <unk> on a <unk> . this ensures that each step obeys <unk> as well as an invariance property of the criterion . we show in simulations that <unk> outperforms a previous <unk> and apply <unk> to a real high dimensional functional magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- fmri -rrb- data .

<unk> approaches allow a <unk> to identify reliable workers to whom tasks can be <unk> . in <unk> that can be modeled as <unk> consist of <unk> -lrb- i.e. , workers -rrb- , workers may need to further <unk> tasks to others if they determine that they can not complete all pending tasks before the <unk> deadlines . existing <unk> can not help workers decide when and to whom to <unk> tasks . in this paper , we proposed a <unk> to bridge this gap . by jointly considering a <unk> , <unk> , the price of its effort and its trust relationships with others , <unk> can be implemented as an <unk> to help workers make <unk> in a distributed manner . the resulting task allocation maximizes social welfare through efficient utilization of the collective capacity of a crowd , and provides provable performance guarantees . experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches based on the <unk> demonstrate significant advantages of <unk> under <unk> .

in this work , a novel approach for <unk> is proposed . the main innovative idea of the proposed method is to model only the small region of the <unk> around the direct path by a group of <unk> , to estimate a <unk> by correlations between the <unk> , and to describe the remaining <unk> by a simple <unk> with the <unk> determined in the aforementioned way . while the <unk> of such a system increases only slightly in comparison to a <unk> , experiments with <unk> from a <unk> in different environments confirm a significantly increased <unk> performance .

a method of <unk> in images is proposed . possible conngurations are evaluated using the <unk> , a <unk> which is derived from a <unk> of the <unk> . we treat each step in this process probabilistically , including the occurrence of <unk> , and derive the <unk> for both correct \ target '' <unk> and incorrect \ clutter '' conngurations . the <unk> distinguishes target objects from the background even in heavy clutter , making only the most general assumptions about the form that clutter might take . the method generates samples <unk> to avoid the cost of processing an entire <unk> , and promises to be particularly suited to the task of <unk> based on <unk> .

with improved <unk> for <unk> , it has become possible to search large collections of <unk> for a variety of information . the <unk> is one such collection , in which we are interested in automatically transcribing and retrieving portions that are relevant to <unk> such as people , places , and organizations . since the <unk> were gathered from thousands of people in countries throughout europe , an extremely large number of potential <unk> are possible , and this causes a well-known dilemma : increasing the size of the vocabulary allows for more of these words to be recognized , but also increases confusability , and can harm <unk> performance . however , the <unk> , like many other collections , includes <unk> or <unk> that can be exploited to provide prior information on exactly which <unk> are likely to appear . this paper proposes a method that capitalizes on this prior information to reduce <unk> by over 50 % relative , and simultaneously decrease the overall <unk> by 7 % relative . the <unk> we use derives from a <unk> that includes the names of friends , relatives , places visited , membership of organizations , synonyms of place names , and similar information . by augmenting the <unk> with this information on a <unk> , we are able to exploit the <unk> that is already available in the corpus to facilitate much improved <unk> .

when the goal is to achieve the best correct <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are typical <unk> used to optimize <unk> performance . however , for many <unk> , the <unk> is a more meaningful performance measure . we demonstrate that minimizing <unk> or <unk> does not necessarily maximize the area under the <unk> . we then consider alternative objective functions for training a <unk> to maximize the <unk> directly . we propose an <unk> that is an approximation to the <unk> , which is equivalent to the <unk> . the proposed <unk> is differentiable , so <unk> can be used to train the <unk> . we apply the new <unk> to <unk> for a <unk> and a <unk> , and achieve reliable improvements in the <unk> .

point-based algorithms have been surprisingly successful in computing approximately optimal solutions for partially observable markov decision processes -lrb- pomdps -rrb- in <unk> . in this work , we seek to understand the <unk> that allow some <unk> to be approximated efficiently and thus help to explain the <unk> ' success often observed in the experiments . we show that an approximately optimal <unk> can be computed in <unk> in the covering number of a <unk> , which is the subset of the <unk> reachable from a given belief point . we also show that under the weaker condition of having a small covering number for an <unk> , which is the subset of the <unk> reachable under an <unk> , computing an approximately optimal solution is np-hard . however , given a suitable set of points that '' cover '' an optimal <unk> space well , an <unk> can be computed in <unk> . the covering number highlights several interesting properties that reduce the complexity of <unk> in practice , e.g. , <unk> , <unk> with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .

many domains are naturally organized in an <unk> or <unk> , where the instances in '' nearby '' classes in the <unk> are similar . in this paper , we provide a general <unk> for <unk> into a set of classes organized as a <unk> , where each class is associated with a <unk> from which the data was generated . the <unk> simultaneously optimizes three things : the assignment of data instances to <unk> , the models associated with the <unk> , and the structure of the <unk> . a unique feature of our <unk> is that <unk> utilizes <unk> for both of the last two steps , reducing the <unk> to <unk> and the <unk> to <unk> that are characteristic of algorithms that only take <unk> . we provide a <unk> for our <unk> , showing that <unk> converges to a local maximum of the probability of model and data . we present experimental results on <unk> , and on <unk> in the domains of gene expression and text .

clustering is a basic task in a variety of <unk> . partitioning a set of <unk> into compact , <unk> can be severely affected by the presence of <unk> called <unk> . the present paper develops robust clustering algorithms for jointly partitioning the data and identifying the <unk> . the novel approach relies on translating <unk> to <unk> in a <unk> , to <unk> three widely used <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . <unk> and assignments are iteratively updated in <unk> . the developed <unk> are guaranteed to converge , while their <unk> is of the same order as their <unk> . preliminary simulations validate the analytical claims .

in <unk> , most of the <unk> starts from <unk> and <unk> . these two steps <unk> the word from a sequence of characters and predict the <unk> for each <unk> . in this paper , we present two distinct <unk> for the above two tasks . the first <unk> was basically similar to previous work which made use of <unk> and set of <unk> to recognize <unk> . second , we revise and modify <unk> to label the <unk> in the <unk> . our <unk> in the <unk> achieves moderately <unk> among all participants , while in the <unk> , it reaches very competitive results .

robust <unk> is defined for the <unk> with <unk> . in the form of a robust spectrogram -lrb- <unk> -rrb- <unk> can be used for the <unk> . in this paper a <unk> , with a <unk> , is presented . the optimal choice of the <unk> can resolve the <unk> in the <unk> . however , <unk> depends on the unknown nonlinearity of the <unk> . the <unk> used in this paper is able to provide the <unk> close to the one that could be achieved if the <unk> , to be estimated , were known in advance . simulations show good <unk> ability of the <unk> and good robustness property with respect to <unk> .

random <unk> has been suggested as a means of <unk> , where the original data are projected onto a <unk> using a <unk> . it represents a <unk> that approximately preserves the <unk> of any two points through the <unk> . moreover , as we are able to produce various <unk> , there may be some possibility of finding a <unk> that gives a better <unk> among these <unk> . in this paper , we investigate the feasibility of <unk> for <unk> . to obtain an optimal result from among many -lrb- infinite -rrb- <unk> , a <unk> is introduced in this paper , where <unk> is applied to <unk> . its effectiveness is confirmed by <unk> experiments .

this paper introduces an approach for enabling existing <unk> to operate on extremely large <unk> . the main idea is to decompose the collection into a set of overlapping sets of photos that can be processed in parallel , and to merge the resulting reconstructions . this <unk> is formulated as a <unk> and solved iteratively . the <unk> , designed to be parallel and out-of-core , incorporates robust <unk> to eliminate <unk> and enforce <unk> . the approach has been tested on several large datasets downloaded from <unk> , including one with over ten thousand images , yielding a <unk> with nearly thirty million points .

in <unk> , the common <unk> between training and testing make <unk> essential . however , <unk> is difficult to manually divide into the <unk> required by <unk> , and the standard practice of <unk> datasets with domains is a weak proxy for all the real conditions that alter the statistics in complex ways -lrb- lighting , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc. -rrb- we propose an approach to automatically discover <unk> in <unk> . our formulation imposes two key properties on domains : <unk> and <unk> . by <unk> , we require the underlying distributions of the identified domains to be different from each other to the <unk> ; by <unk> , we ensure that a strong <unk> can be learned from the domain . we devise a <unk> and efficient <unk> that can successfully discover domains among both <unk> . we extensively evaluate our approach on <unk> and <unk> .

the <unk> of the new <unk> , <unk> , is strongly associated with better use of <unk> thanks to an increased number of competing <unk> . however , this competition involves a massive increase in <unk> which becomes a possible limit for the next generation of <unk> . this paper proposes a new <unk> that breaks with conventional approaches . <unk> exploits a more complex <unk> able to reproduce the choice of the <unk> based on <unk> , eliminating thus the need to <unk> and associated parameters . the general outline of this new <unk> and a proposed implementation are described in this paper . experimental results under common test conditions report an <unk> of 1.7 % at the same quality compared to <unk> for a wide range of <unk> .

-lrb- <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> 2001 -rrb- introduced a formula to predict the number of nodes ida * will expand given the <unk> . their formula proved to be very accurate but it is only accurate under the following limitations : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the <unk> must be consistent ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- the prediction is for a large <unk> of <unk> -lrb- or for large thresholds -rrb- . in this paper we generalize the <unk> to a <unk> . we then propose a new formula for predicting the performance of ida * that works well for <unk> -lrb- <unk> et al. 2007 -rrb- and for any set of <unk> , not just a <unk> . we also show how the formula can be enhanced to work well for <unk> . experimental results demonstrate the <unk> of our method in all these situations .

in this paper , a new <unk> by using <unk> is proposed to identify <unk> . the proposed <unk> provides estimates to the <unk> by finding a global minimum of an <unk> . since the <unk> is formulated in the <unk> function -lrb- <unk> -rrb- domain of the <unk> and the received array outputs , the proposed <unk> is called as <unk> . the performance of the <unk> is compared with the space alternating <unk> and with another recently proposed <unk> for various <unk> . simulation results indicate the superior performance of the <unk> over mentioned techniques for all <unk> .
