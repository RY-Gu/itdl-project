we consider the STOCHASTIC MULTI-ARMED BANDIT PROBLEM with a PRIOR DISTRIBUTION on the REWARD DISTRIBUTIONS . we are interested in studying PRIOR-FREE AND PRIOR-DEPENDENT REGRET BOUNDS , very much in the same spirit than the usual DISTRIBUTION-FREE AND DISTRIBUTION-DEPENDENT BOUNDS for the NON-BAYESIAN STOCHASTIC BANDIT . we first show that THOMPSON SAMPLING attains an optimal <unk> bound in the sense that for any PRIOR DISTRIBUTION its BAYESIAN REGRET is bounded from above by 14  <unk> . this result is <unk> in the sense that there exists a PRIOR DISTRIBUTION such that any algorithm has a BAYESIAN REGRET bounded from below by 1 20  <unk> . we also study the case of THOMPSON SAMPLING for the setting of <unk> et al. -lsb- 2013 -rsb- -lrb- where the optimal mean is known as well as a lower bound on the smallest gap -rrb- and we show that in this case the regret of THOMPSON SAMPLING is in fact uniformly bounded over time , thus showing that THOMPSON SAMPLING can greatly take advantage of the nice properties of these THOMPSON SAMPLING .

we propose a BLOCK-ITERATIVE PARALLEL DECOMPOSITION METHOD to solve QUADRATIC SIGNAL RECOVERY PROBLEMS under CONVEX CONSTRAINTS . the idea of the BLOCK-ITERATIVE PARALLEL DECOMPOSITION METHOD is to <unk> the original MULTI-CONSTRAINT PROBLEM into a sequence of simple QUADRATIC MINIMIZATIONS over the intersection of two <unk> constructed by linearizing blocks of constraints . the implementation of the BLOCK-ITERATIVE PARALLEL DECOMPOSITION METHOD is quite exible thanks to its BLOCK-PARALLEL STRUCTURE . in addition a wide range of complex constraints can be incorporated since the BLOCK-ITERATIVE PARALLEL DECOMPOSITION METHOD does not require exact CONSTRAINT ENFORCEMENT at each step but merely APPROXIMATE ENFORCEMENT via LINEARIZATION . an application to DECONVOLUTION is demonstrated .

this paper considers an AUTOMATIC VOICE RESPONSE APPLICATION in which a WORD UTTERANCE is inserted into a fixed carrier sentence . an important task here is to adjust the F 0 CONTOUR of the INSERTED WORD according to the F 0 CONTEXT of the carrier sentence . instead of generating the F 0 CONTOUR on syllable basis , we employ an approach to adjust the F 0 CONTOUR of the whole word . in this approach , two questions arise : -lrb- a -rrb- how to evaluate the F 0 CONTEXT and -lrb- b -rrb- how to adjust the F 0 CONTOUR suitably for the context . we have found that the F 0 CONTOUR of a word can be appropriately regulated in a <unk> word-level f 0 range -lrb- <unk> 0 r -rrb- . after estimating the WF 0 RS of the preceding and succeeding words , the <unk> 0 r of the INSERTED WORD is set at the mean of these WF 0 RS . the F 0 CONTOUR of the INSERTED WORD is then mapped to the <unk> 0 r taking into account the TONE COMBINATION of the word . a perceptual evaluation experiment showed that the adjusted f 0 was coordinated well with the context .

this paper proposes a framework for training CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS to optimize MULTIVARIATE EVALUATION MEASURES , including NON-LINEAR MEASURES such as F-SCORE . our proposed framework is derived from an ERROR MINIMIZATION APPROACH that provides a simple solution for directly optimizing any EVALUATION MEASURE . specifically focusing on SEQUENTIAL SEGMENTATION TASKS , i.e. TEXT CHUNKING and NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION , we introduce a LOSS FUNCTION that closely reflects the TARGET EVALUATION MEASURE for these SEQUENTIAL SEGMENTATION TASKS , namely , SEGMENTATION F-SCORE . our experiments show that our method performs better than standard CRF TRAINING .

various representations and INFERENCE METHODS have been proposed for LIFTED PROBABILISTIC INFERENCE in RELA-TIONAL MODELS . many of these INFERENCE METHODS choose an order to eliminate -lrb- or branch on -rrb- the PARAMETERIZED RANDOM VARIABLES . similar to such INFERENCE METHODS for NON-RELATIONAL PROBABILISTIC INFERENCE , the order of elimination has a significant role in the performance of the INFERENCE METHODS . since finding the best order is NP-COMPLETE even for RELATIONAL MODELS , heuristics have been proposed to find good orderings in the RELATIONAL MODELS . in this paper , we show that these heuristics are inefficient for RELATIONAL MODELS , because they fail to consider the POPULATION SIZES associated with LOGICAL VARIABLES . we extend existing heuristics for RELATIONAL MODELS and propose new heuristics for RELATIONAL MODELS . we evaluate the existing and new heuristics on a range of GENERATED RELATIONAL GRAPHS .

we optimize over the set of CORRECTED LAPLACIANS associated with a WEIGHTED GRAPH to improve the AVERAGE CASE NORMALIZED CUT of a GRAPH PARTITIONING . unlike EDGE-RELAXATION SDPS , optimizing over the set cl naturally exploits the MATRIX SPARSITY by operating solely on the diagonal . this structure is critical to IMAGE SEGMENTATION APPLICATIONS because the number of vertices is generally proportional to the number of pixels in the image . CL OPTIMIZATION provides a guiding principle for improving the COMBINATORIAL SOLUTION over the SPECTRAL RELAXATION , which is important because small improvements in the CUT COST often result in significant improvements in the PERCEPTUAL RELEVANCE of the segmenta-tion . we develop an OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURE to accommodate PRIOR INFORMATION in the form of STATISTICAL SHAPE MODELS , resulting in a SEGMENTATION METHOD that produces FOREGROUND REGIONS which are consistent with a PARAMETERIZED FAMILY OF SHAPES . we validate our OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURE with GROUND TRUTH on MRI MEDICAL IMAGES , providing a QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON against results produced by current SPECTRAL RELAXATION APPROACHES to GRAPH PARTITIONING .

we consider a MULTIPLE-INPUT MULTIPLE-OUTPUT WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SCENARIO in which the channel follows a general SPATIALLY-CORRELATED COMPLEX GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION with NON-ZERO MEAN . we derive an explicit characterization of the optimal input covariance from an ERGODIC RATE PERSPECTIVE for systems that operate at LOW SNRS . this characterization is in terms of the <unk> decomposition of a matrix that depends on the mean and the covariance of the channel , and typically results in a BEAMFORMING STRATEGY along the principal eigenvector of that matrix . simulation results show the potential impact of -lrb- jointly -rrb- exploiting the mean and the covariance of the channel on the ERGODIC ACHIEVABLE RATE at both low and <unk> snrs .

spectral EMBEDDING based on the SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION is a widely used '' preprocessing '' step in many LEARNING TASKS , typically leading to DI-MENSIONALITY REDUCTION by projecting onto a number of DOMINANT SINGULAR VECTORS and <unk> the COORDINATE AXES -lrb- by a PREDEFINED FUNCTION of the singular value -rrb- . however , the number of such vectors required to capture PROBLEM STRUCTURE grows with PROBLEM SIZE , and even PARTIAL SVD COMPUTATION becomes a bottleneck . in this paper , we propose a LOW-COMPLEXITY COMPRESSIVE SPECTRAL EMBEDDING ALGORITHM , which employs RANDOM PROJECTIONS and FINITE ORDER POLYNOMIAL EXPANSIONS to compute approximations to SVD-BASED EMBEDDING . for an M  N MATRIX with T NON-ZEROS , its TIME COMPLEXITY is o -lrb- -lrb- t + m + n -rrb- log -lrb- m + n -rrb- -rrb- , and the EMBEDDING DIMENSION is o -lrb- log -lrb- m + n -rrb- -rrb- , both of which are independent of the number of SINGULAR VECTORS whose effect we wish to capture . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to circumvent this dependence on the number of SINGULAR VECTORS for GENERAL SVD-BASED EMBEDDINGS . the key to <unk> the SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION is the observation that , for DOWNSTREAM INFERENCE TASKS such as CLUSTERING and classification , we are only interested in using the resulting EMBEDDING to evaluate PAIRWISE SIMILARITY METRICS derived from the  2-norm , rather than capturing the effect of the underlying MATRIX on ARBITRARY VECTORS as a partial SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION tries to do . our numerical results on NETWORK DATASETS demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed LOW-COMPLEXITY COMPRESSIVE SPECTRAL EMBEDDING ALGORITHM , and motivate further exploration of its application to DOWNSTREAM INFERENCE TASKS .

-- TRANSMIT-REFERENCE ULTRA-WIDEBAND SYSTEMS are attractive due to their relatively low COMPLEXITY at both the TRANSMITTER and the receiver . partly , this is achieved by making RESTRICTIVE ASSUMPTIONS such as a FRAME LENGTH which should be much larger than the CHANNEL LENGTH . this limits their use to low data rate applications . in this paper , we lift this restriction and allow INTER-FRAME INTERFERENCE to occur . we propose a suitable SIGNAL PROCESSING DATA MODEL and corresponding RECEIVER ALGORITHMS which take the INTER-FRAME INTERFERENCE into account . the performance of the SIGNAL PROCESSING DATA MODEL are verified using simulations . 
GEN
in this paper , we present a new method for transmit-reference ultra-wideband systems that is based on the signal processing data model of the signal processing data model . the proposed method is based on the fact that the frame length of the signal processing data model is independent of the frame length and the receiver . the proposed algorithm is based on a signal processing data model of the frame length of the signal processing data model , which is based on the fact that the transmitter of the transmitter is independent of the channel length and the number of inter-frame interference . the complexity of the algorithm is very close to that of the receiver algorithms . simulations with real data show the effectiveness of the proposed method .

we introduce a new application of ONLINE DIALOGUE ANALYSIS : supporting PEDAGOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF ONLINE Q&A DISCUSSIONS . extending the existing SPEECH ACT FRAMEWORK , we capture common EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIONS that often appear in STUDENT DISCUSSIONS , such as frustration and degree of certainty , and present a viable approach for the CLASSIFICATION . we demonstrate how such dialogue information can be used in analyzing STUDENT DISCUSSIONS and identifying difficulties . in particular , the DIFFICULTY EXPRESSIONS are aligned to DISCUSSION PATTERNS and student performance . we found that frustration occurs more frequently in longer discussions . the students who frequently express frustration tend to get lower <unk> than others . on the other hand , frequency of HIGH CERTAINTY EXPRESSIONS is positively correlated with the performance . we expect such dialogue analyses can become a powerful ASSESSMENT TOOL for instructors and education researchers .

in this paper , we propose a new approach for theory-guided induction of logic programs based on recursive clauses and recursive clauses . our approach is based on the idea of using resolution-based approaches , which we call recursive denition . we show that recursive denition and recursive clauses can be used to solve the theory-guided induction of logic programs in a logic program . we also show how the method can be applied to solve the theory-guided induction of logic programs in a logic program . we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying resolution-based approaches to the theory-guided induction of logic programs .

many COMPUTER VISION PROBLEMS can be formulated as BINARY QUADRATIC PROGRAMS . two classic RELAXATION METHODS are widely used for solving BINARY QUADRATIC PROGRAMS , namely , SPECTRAL METHODS and SEMIDEFINITE PROGRAMMING , each with their own advantages and disadvantages . BINARY QUADRATIC PROGRAMS is simple and easy to implement , but its bound is loose . BINARY QUADRATIC PROGRAMS has a tighter bound , but its COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY is high for LARGE SCALE PROBLEMS . we present a new SDP FORMULATION for BINARY QUADRATIC PROGRAMS , with two desirable properties . first , SDP FORMULATION has a similar relaxation bound to conventional SDP FORMULATIONS . second , compared with conventional SDP FORMULATIONS , the new SDP FORMULATION leads to a significantly more efficient and scalable DUAL OPTIMIZATION APPROACH , which has the same degree of COMPLEXITY as SPECTRAL METHODS . extensive experiments on various applications including CLUSTERING , IMAGE SEGMEN-TATION , CO-SEGMENTATION and REGISTRATION demonstrate the usefulness of our SDP FORMULATION for solving LARGE-SCALE BQPS .

temporal processing and FILTERING in SPEECH FEATURE EXTRACTION are commonly used to aid in performance and ROBUSTNESS in AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION . among the techniques successfully employed are RASTA FILTERING , DELTA CALCULATION , and CEPSTRAL MEAN SUBTRACTION . the work here explores the use of TEMPORAL FILTER DESIGN using LDA FILTERS to further enhance performance using a few PREPROCESSING CONFIGURATIONS . in addition to RASTA FILTERING , we apply the TEMPORAL FILTER DESIGN to MODULATION-SPECTRAL FEATURES and <unk> while making sure that the assumptions of LDA FILTERS are observed . we additionally test the use of TEMPORAL FILTER DESIGN that have been trained in different REVERBERATION CONDITIONS , noting from previous work that the presence of REVERBERATION alters the preferred frequency range of the derived TEMPORAL FILTER DESIGN . our tests indicate a consistent advantage in PHONE CLASSIFICATION . WORD RECOGNITION TESTS , in contrast , reveal that the LDA FILTERS often do not improve upon the existing TEMPORAL FILTER DESIGN previously used . they can also be made less <unk> by allowing CONTEXTUAL FRAMES to a TRAINED PROBABILITY ESTIMATOR .

spoken queries are a natural medium for searching the MOBILE WEB . LANGUAGE MODELING for VOICE SEARCH RECOGNITION offers different challenges compared to more conventional SPEECH APPLICATIONS . the challenges arise from the fact that SPOKEN QUERIES are usually a set of KEYWORDS and do not have a SYNTACTIC AND GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE . this paper describes a CO-OCCURRENCE BASED APPROACH to improve the ACCURACY of VOICE QUERIES AUTOMATIC TRANSCRIPTION . with the right choice of SCORING FUNCTION and CO-OCCURRENCE LEVEL , we show that CO-OCCURRENCE INFORMATION gives a 2 % RELATIVE ACCURACY improvement over a state of the art system .

one of the most difficult tasks in VALUE FUNCTION APPROXIMATION for MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES is finding an APPROXIMATION ARCHITECTURE that is expressive enough to capture the important structure in the VALUE FUNCTION , while at the same time not overfitting the training samples . recent results in NON-PARAMETRIC APPROXIMATE LINEAR PROGRAMMING , have demonstrated that this can be done effectively using nothing more than a SMOOTHNESS ASSUMPTION on the VALUE FUNCTION . in this paper we extend these results to the case where samples come from REAL WORLD TRANSITIONS instead of the full BELLMAN EQUATION , adding ROBUSTNESS to NOISE . in addition , we provide the first <unk> , finite sample performance guarantees for any form of ALP . NON-PARAMETRIC APPROXIMATE LINEAR PROGRAMMING is amenable to problems with large -lrb- multidimensional -rrb- or even INFINITE ACTION SPACES , and does not require a model to select actions using the resulting APPROXIMATE SOLUTION .

<unk> <unk> poses a particularly diicult challenge for conventional MONOPULSE RADARS . in such cases SPATIALLY ADAPTIVE PROCESSING provides some INTERFERENCE SUPPRESSION when the target and JAMMER are not exactly <unk> , but the resulting ARRAY PATTERN is too distorted to be suitable for MONOPULSE PROCESSING . the presence of COHERENT MULTI-PATH in the form of TERRAIN SCATTERED INTERFERENCE is normally considered a nuisance source of interference . however , it can also be exploited to suppress MAINBEAM JAMMING with SPACE-TIME PROCESSING . here we present a method for incorporating SPACE-TIME PROCESSING into MONOPULSE PROCESSING to yield a SPACE-TIME MONOPULSE PROCESSOR with DIS-TORTIONLESS SPATIAL ARRAY PATTERNS that can achieve far better MAINBEAM JAMMING CANCELATION and TARGET ANGLE ESTIMATION than has been previously possible . performance results for the SPACE-TIME MONOPULSE PROCESSOR are obtained for MOUNTAINTOP DATA containing a JAMMER and TERRAIN SCATTERED INTERFERENCE , that demonstrate a dramatic improvement in performance over conventional MONOPULSE AND SPATIALLY ADAPTIVE MONOPULSE .

environmental MONITORING APPLICATIONS present a challenge to current BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION ALGORITHMS that analyze the TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF PIXEL INTENSITIES , due to the complex texture and motion of the scene . they also present a challenge to SEGMENTATION ALGORITHMS that compare INTENSITY OR COLOR DISTRIBUTIONS between the foreground and the background in each image independently , because objects of interest such as animals have adapted to blend in . therefore , we have developed a BACKGROUND MODELING AND SUBTRACTION SCHEME that analyzes the temporal variation of INTENSITY OR COLOR DISTRIBUTIONS , instead of either looking at TEMPORAL VARIATION OF POINT STATISTICS , or the SPATIAL VARIATION OF REGION STATISTICS in isolation . DISTRIBUTIONAL SIGNATURES are less sensitive to movements of the TEX-TURED BACKGROUND , and at the same time DISTRIBUTIONAL SIGNATURES are more robust than individual pixel statistics in DETECTING FOREGROUND OBJECTS . they also enable slow background update , which is crucial in MONITORING APPLICATIONS where PROCESSING POWER comes at a <unk> , and where FOREGROUND OBJECTS , when present , may move less than the background and therefore disappear into it when a fast update scheme is used . our BACKGROUND MODELING AND SUBTRACTION SCHEME compares favorably with the state of the art both in GENERIC LOW-LEVEL DETECTION METRICS , as well as in APPLICATION-DEPENDENT CRITERIA .

we introduce a new CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM based on the concept of SYMMETRIC MAXIMIZED MINIMAL DISTANCE in subspace -lrb- SMMS -rrb- . given the training data of authentic samples and IMPOSTER SAMPLES in the FEATURE SPACE , SMMS tries to identify a SUBSPACE in which all the authentic samples are close to each other and all the IMPOSTER SAMPLES are far away from the authentic samples . the OPTIMALITY of the SUBSPACE is determined by maximizing the minimal distance between the authentic samples and the IMPOSTER SAMPLES in the SUBSPACE . we present a procedure to achieve such OPTIMALITY and to identify the DECISION BOUNDARY . the verification procedure is simple since we only need to project the test sample to the SUBSPACE and compare it against the DECISION BOUNDARY . using FACE AUTHENTICATION as an example , we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several other algorithms based on SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES .

this paper presents a VOICE CONVERSION TECHNIQUE using DEEP BELIEF NETS to build HIGH-ORDER EIGEN SPACES of the <unk> speakers , where VOICE CONVERSION TECHNIQUE is easier to convert the source speech to the target speech than in the traditional CEPSTRUM SPACE .

naive bayes -lrb- nb -rrb- is well-known to be a simple but effective CLASSIFIER , especially when combined with FEATURE SELECTION . unfortunately , FEATURE SELECTION METHODS are often greedy and thus can not guarantee an optimal feature set is selected . an alternative to FEATURE SELECTION is to use BAYESIAN MODEL averaging -lrb- BMA -rrb- , which computes a weighted average over multiple predictors ; when the different PREDICTOR MODELS correspond to different feature sets , BMA has the advantage over FEATURE SELECTION that its predictions tend to have lower variance on average in comparison to any single model . in this paper , we show for the first time that BMA-NB CLASSIFIER is possible to exactly evaluate BMA over the <unk> <unk> of NB FEATURE MODELS in linear-time in the number of FEATURES ; this yields an algorithm about as expensive to train as a single NB MODEL with all FEATURES , but yet provably converges to the GLOBALLY OPTIMAL FEATURE SUBSET in the ASYMPTOTIC LIMIT OF DATA . we evaluate this novel BMA-NB CLASSIFIER on a range of datasets showing that BMA-NB CLASSIFIER never <unk> nb -lrb- as expected -rrb- and sometimes offers performance competitive -lrb- or superior -rrb- to CLASSIFIERS such as SVMS and logistic regression while taking a fraction of the time to train .

voice morphing is a technique for modifying a source speaker 's speech to sound as if VOICE MORPHING was spoken by some designated target speaker . most of the recent approaches to VOICE MORPHING apply a LINEAR TRANSFORMATION to the SPECTRAL ENVELOPE and PITCH SCALING to modify the PROSODY . whilst these methods are effective , they also introduce artifacts arising from the effects of GLOTTAL COUPLING , PHASE INCOHERENCE , UNNATURAL PHASE DISPERSION and the HIGH SPECTRAL VARIANCE OF UNVOICED SOUNDS . a practical VOICE MORPHING SYSTEM must account for these if high AUDIO QUALITY is to be preserved . this paper describes a complete VOICE MORPHING SYSTEM and the enhancements needed for dealing with the various artifacts , including a novel method for synthesising NATURAL PHASE DISPERSION . each technique is assessed individually and the overall performance of the VOICE MORPHING SYSTEM evaluated using LISTENING TESTS . overall VOICE MORPHING is found that the enhancements significantly improve SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION SCORES and PERCEIVED AUDIO QUALITY .

a common approach in VISUAL SPEECH SYNTHESIS is the use of VISEMES as ATOMIC UNITS OF SPEECH . in this paper , PHONEME-BASED AND VISEME-BASED AUDIOVISUAL SPEECH SYNTHESIS TECHNIQUES are compared in order to explore the balancing between data availability and an improved AUDIOVISUAL COHERENCE for SYNTHESIS OPTIMIZATION . a technique for AUTOMATIC VISEME CLUSTERING is described and it is compared to the STANDARDIZED VISEME SET described in MPEG-4 . both objective and subjective testing indicated that a <unk> approach leads to better synthesis results . in addition , the test results improve when more different VISEMES are defined . this raises some questions on the widely applied <unk> approach . it appears that a MANY-TO-ONE PHONEME-TO-VISEME MAPPING is not capable of describing all subtle details of the VISUAL SPEECH INFORMATION . in addition , with VISEME-BASED SYNTHESIS the PERCEIVED SYNTHESIS QUALITY is affected by the loss of AUDIOVISUAL COHERENCE in the SYNTHETIC SPEECH .

in the WRAPPER APPROACH for FEATURE SELECTION , a popular criterion used is the LEAVE-ONE-OUT ESTIMATE of the CLASSIFICATION ERROR . while being relatively unbiased , the LEAVE-ONE-OUT ERROR ESTIMATE is nonetheless known to exhibit a large variance , which can be detrimental especially for small samples . we propose reducing its variance -lrb- i.e. smoothing -rrb- at two levels . at the first level , we smooth the ERROR COUNT using ESTIMATES OF POSTERIOR PROBABILITIES ; while at the second level , we smooth the POSTERIOR PROBABILITY ESTIMATES themselves using BAYESIAN ESTIMATION with CONJUGATE PRIORS . furthermore , we propose using the JACKKNIFE to reduce the BIAS inherent in BAYESIAN ESTIMATORS . we then show empirically that smoothing the ERROR ESTIMATE gives improved performance in FEATURE SELECTION . 
GEN
in this paper , we propose a new wrapper approach for feature selection in posterior probability estimates . the bias is based on the estimates of posterior probabilities between the estimates of posterior probabilities and the estimates of posterior probabilities of the leave-one-out estimate . the bias of the leave-one-out estimate is estimated using a leave-one-out error estimate . the resulting error estimate is shown to be very effective for feature selection .

in this paper , we present a new approach for degraded speech restoration based on low-level auditory mechanisms . the method is based on low-level auditory mechanisms , which is based on the low-level auditory mechanisms of the speech signal . it is shown that the medial olivocochlear bundle functionality of the auditory system is independent of the low-level auditory mechanisms , and that the resulting algorithm is capable of handling both high and low level mechanisms and interindividual variability . it is shown in our experiments that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve higher performance than the other higher-level strategies .

we present a new approach to QUASI TEXT-INDEPENDENT SPEAKER VERIFICATION based on PATTERN MATCHING . our method first seeks PHONETICALLY MATCHED SEGMENTS in two SPEECH SIGNALS . for all aligned frame pairs of these segments we compute the probability that they were uttered by the same speaker . based on these FRAME-LEVEL PROBABILITIES we take the decision whether the two signals were spoken by the same speaker or not . our method to find PHONETICALLY MATCHED SEGMENTS does not depend on a SPEECH RECOGNIZER . we show that our system performs better than a baseline speaker verification system based on GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODELS when the signals are long enough . especially interesting is the fact that a combination of the devised system with the baseline system performs much better than either of the systems alone .

causal structure learning from TIME SERIES DATA is a major scientific challenge . EXTANT ALGORITHMS assume that measurements occur sufficiently quickly ; more precisely , they assume approximately equal system and measurement timescales . in many domains , however , measurements occur at a significantly slower rate than the underlying system changes , but the size of the TIMESCALE MISMATCH is often unknown . this paper develops three CAUSAL STRUCTURE LEARNING ALGORITHMS , each of which discovers all DYNAMIC CAUSAL GRAPHS that explain the OBSERVED MEASUREMENT DATA , perhaps given UNDERSAMPLING . that is , these CAUSAL STRUCTURE LEARNING ALGORITHMS all learn CAUSAL STRUCTURE in a `` <unk> '' manner : they do not assume any particular relation between the measurement and system timescales . we apply these CAUSAL STRUCTURE LEARNING ALGORITHMS to data from simulations to gain insight into the challenge of UNDERSAMPLING .

in GAME-PLAYING PROGRAMS relying on the MINIMAX PRINCIPLE , DEEPER SEARCHES generally produce better evaluations . theoretical analyses , however , suggest that in many cases <unk> amplifies the NOISE introduced by the HEURISTIC FUNCTION used to evaluate the leaves of the GAME TREE , leading to what is known as PATHOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR , where DEEPER SEARCHES produce worse evaluations . in most of the previous research , positions were evaluated as losses or wins . dependence between the values of positions close to each other was identified as the property of realistic GAME TREES that eliminates the PATHOLOGY and explains why MINIMAX is successful in practice . in this paper we present an alternative explanation that does not rely on VALUE DEPENDENCE . we show that if real numbers are used for POSITION VALUES , POSITION VALUES tend to be further apart at lower levels of the GAME TREE , which leads to a larger proportion of more extreme positions , where error is less probable . decreased probability of error in searches to greater depths is sufficient to eliminate the PATHOLOGY and no additional properties of GAME TREES are required .

the majority of the existing algorithms for LEARNING DECISION TREES are greedy -- a TREE is induced top-down , making locally optimal decisions at each node . in most cases , however , the CONSTRUCTED TREE is not globally optimal . furthermore , the GREEDY ALGORITHMS require a fixed amount of time and are not able to generate a better TREE if additional time is available . to overcome this problem , we present two LOOKAHEAD-BASED ALGORITHMS for ANYTIME INDUCTION OF DECISION TREES , thus allowing tradeoff between TREE QUALITY and LEARNING TIME . the first one is DEPTH-K LOOKAHEAD , where a larger TIME ALLOCATION permits larger k . the second algorithm uses a novel strategy for evaluating candidate splits ; a STOCHASTIC VERSION of ID3 is repeatedly invoked to estimate the size of the TREE in which each split results , and the one that minimizes the expected size is preferred . experimental results indicate that for several hard concepts , our proposed approach exhibits good anytime behavior and yields significantly better DECISION TREES when more time is available .

with the growing popularity of SHORT-FORM VIDEO SHARING PLATFORMS such as INSTAGRAM and <unk> , there has been an increasing need for techniques that automatically extract highlights from video . whereas prior works have approached this problem with HEURISTIC RULES or SUPERVISED LEARNING , we present an UNSUPERVISED LEARNING APPROACH that takes advantage of the abundance of USER-EDITED VIDEOS on SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES such as YOUTUBE . based on the idea that the most significant sub-events within a VIDEO CLASS are commonly present among EDITED VIDEOS while less interesting ones appear less frequently , we identify the significant sub-events via a ROBUST RECURRENT AUTO-ENCODER trained on a collection of USER-EDITED VIDEOS queried for each particular class of interest . the ROBUST RECURRENT AUTO-ENCODER is trained using a proposed SHRINKING EXPONENTIAL LOSS FUNCTION that makes ROBUST RECURRENT AUTO-ENCODER robust to NOISE in the WEB-CRAWLED TRAINING DATA , and is configured with bidirectional long short term memory -lrb- lstm -rrb- -lsb- 5 -rsb- cells to better model the TEMPORAL STRUCTURE OF HIGHLIGHT SEGMENTS . different from SUPERVISED TECHNIQUES , our UNSUPERVISED LEARNING APPROACH can infer highlights using only a set of DOWN-LOADED EDITED VIDEOS , without also needing their <unk> counterparts which are rarely available online . extensive experiments indicate the promise of our proposed UNSUPERVISED LEARNING APPROACH in this challenging UNSUPERVISED SETTING .

<unk> analysis <unk> in applications of BINARY CLASSIFICATION where true negatives do not add value and hence should not affect assessment of the CLASSIFIER 's performance . perhaps inspired by the many advantages of RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVES and the area under such curves for ACCURACY-BASED PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT , many researchers have taken to report PRECISION-RECALL CURVES and associated areas as PERFORMANCE METRIC . we demonstrate in this paper that this practice is <unk> with difficulties , mainly because of INCOHERENT SCALE ASSUMPTIONS -- e.g. , the area under a PR CURVE takes the ARITHMETIC MEAN OF PRECISION VALUES whereas the F  SCORE applies the harmonic mean . we show how to fix this by plotting PR CURVES in a different COORDINATE SYSTEM , and demonstrate that the new PRECISION-RECALL-GAIN CURVES inherit all key advantages of ROC CURVES . in particular , the area under PRECISION-RECALL-GAIN CURVES conveys an expected f 1 score on a HARMONIC SCALE , and the CONVEX HULL of a PRECISION-RECALL-GAIN CURVE allows us to calibrate the CLASSIFIER 's scores so as to determine , for each operating point on the CONVEX HULL , the INTERVAL OF  VALUES for which the point optimises F  . we demonstrate experimentally that the area under traditional PR CURVES can easily favour models with lower expected f 1 score than others , and so the use of PRECISION-RECALL-GAIN CURVES will result in better MODEL SELECTION .

this paper presents a CLOSED FORM RECURSIVE SOLUTION for training ADAPTIVE FILTERS using the MAXIMUM CORRENTROPY CRITERION . CORRENTROPY has been recently proposed as a robust similarity measure between two RANDOM VARIABLES or signals , when the PDF S involved are heavy <unk> and NON-GAUSSIAN . maximizing the CROSS-CORRENTROPY between the output of an ADAPTIVE FILTERS and the desired response leads to the MAXIMUM CORRENTROPY CRITERION for ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS TRAINING . we show that a CLOSED FORM , CLOSED FORM RECURSIVE SOLUTION of the FILTER WEIGHTS using this CLOSED FORM yields a simple WEIGHTED LEAST SQUARES like formulation . our simulations show that training the FILTER WEIGHTS using this CLOSED FORM RECURSIVE SOLUTION is much faster than GRADIENT BASED TRAINING , and more accurate than the RLS ALGORITHM in cases where the ERROR PDF is NON-GAUSSIAN and heavy <unk> .

we resolve a <unk> old open question in VISIBILITY-BASED PURSUIT EVASION : how many pursuers are needed to capture an evader in an ARBITRARY POLYGONAL ENVIRONMENT with obstacles ? the evader is assumed to be adversarial , moves with the same MAXIMUM SPEED as pursuers , and is '' sensed '' by a <unk> only when it lies in <unk> of that <unk> . the players move in DISCRETE TIME STEPS , and the capture occurs when a <unk> reaches the position of the evader on its move . our main result is that o -lrb-  h + log n -rrb- pursuers can always win the game with a DETERMINISTIC SEARCH STRATEGY in any <unk> with n vertices and h obstacles -lrb- holes -rrb- . in order to achieve this bound , however , we argue that the environment must satisfy a MINIMUM FEATURE SIZE PROPERTY , which essentially requires the MINIMUM DISTANCE between any two vertices to be of the same order as the speed of the players . without the MINIMUM FEATURE SIZE ASSUMPTION , we show that  -lrb- n / log n -rrb- pursuers are needed in the worst-case even for SIMPLY-CONNECTED POLYGONS OF N VERTICES ! this reveals an unexpected <unk> that seems to have been overlooked in previous work <unk> that O -LRB- LOG N -RRB- PURSUERS can always win in SIMPLY-CONNECTED N-GONS . our lower bound also shows that capturing an evader is inherently more difficult than just '' seeing '' it because O -LRB- LOG N -RRB- PURSUERS are prov-ably sufficient for LINE-OF-SIGHT DETECTION even against an arbitrarily fast evader in simple <unk> .

sponsored search is an important MONETIZATION CHANNEL for SEARCH ENGINES , in which an AUCTION MECHANISM is used to select the ads shown to users and determine the prices charged from advertisers . there have been several pieces of work in the literature that investigate how to design an AUCTION MECHANISM in order to optimize the revenue of the SEARCH ENGINES . however , due to some unrealistic assumptions used , the practical values of these studies are not very clear . in this paper , we propose a novel GAME-THEORETIC MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH , which naturally combines MACHINE LEARNING and GAME THEORY , and learns the AUCTION MECHANISM using a BILEVEL OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK . in particular , we first learn a MARKOV MODEL from HISTORICAL DATA to describe how advertisers change their bids in response to an AUCTION MECHANISM , and then for any given AUCTION MECHANISM , we use the learnt MARKOV MODEL to predict its corresponding future bid sequences . next we learn the AUCTION MECHANISM through EMPIRICAL REVENUE MAXIMIZATION on the PREDICTED BID SEQUENCES . we show that the empirical revenue will converge when the PREDICTION PERIOD approaches infinity , and a GENETIC PROGRAMMING ALGORITHM can effectively optimize this empirical revenue . our experiments indicate that the proposed GAME-THEORETIC MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH is able to produce a much more effective AUCTION MECHANISM than several baselines .

RAO-BLACKWELLISED GIBBS SAMPLING explicitly take into account the strong co-articulation present in SPEECH . unfortunately , INFERENCE in RAO-BLACKWELLISED GIBBS SAMPLING is intractable unless the DISCRETE STATE SEQUENCE is known . RAO-BLACKWELLISED GIBBS SAMPLING is one approach that may be applied for both improved training and decoding for this form of INTRACTABLE MODEL . the theory of RAO-BLACKWELLISED GIBBS SAMPLING and RAO-BLACKWELLISED GIBBS SAMPLING is described , along with an efficient PROPOSAL MECHANISM . the performance of the RAO-BLACKWELLISED GIBBS SAMPLING using RAO-BLACKWELLISED GIBBS SAMPLING for training and INFERENCE is evaluated on the ARPA RESOURCE MANAGEMENT TASK .

VISUAL SALIENCY is measured through a SPATIOTEMPORAL ATTENTION MODEL driven by intensity , COLOR and motion . TEXT SALIENCY is extracted from PART-OF-SPEECH TAGGING on the <unk> information available with most MOVIE DISTRIBUTIONS . the various MODALITY CURVES are integrated in a single ATTENTION CURVE , where the presence of an event may be <unk> in one or multiple domains . this MULTIMODAL SALIENCY CURVE is the basis of a BOTTOM-UP VIDEO SUMMARIZATION ALGORITHM , that RESNES results from UNIMODAL OR AUDIOVISUAL-BASED SKIMMING . the BOTTOM-UP VIDEO SUMMARIZATION ALGORITHM performs favorably for VIDEO SUMMARIZATION in terms of informativeness and <unk> .

efficient learning equilibrium -lrb- EFFICIENT LEARNING EQUILIBRIUM -rrb- is a NATURAL SOLUTION CONCEPT for MULTI-AGENT ENCOUNTERS with INCOMPLETE INFORMATION . it requires the LEARNING ALGORITHMS themselves to be in equilibrium for any game selected from a set of -lrb- initially unknown -rrb- games . in an optimal EFFICIENT LEARNING EQUILIBRIUM , the LEARNING ALGORITHMS would efficiently obtain the surplus the agents would obtain in an optimal nash equilibrium of the initially unknown game which is played . the crucial part is that in an ELE DEVIATIONS from the LEARNING ALGORITHMS would become <unk> after POLYNOMIAL TIME , although the game played is initially unknown . while appealing conceptually , the main challenge for establishing LEARNING ALGORITHMS based on this concept is to isolate general classes of games where an EFFICIENT LEARNING EQUILIBRIUM exists . unfortunately , it has been shown that while an EFFICIENT LEARNING EQUILIBRIUM exists for the setting in which each agent can observe all other agents ' actions and payoffs , an EFFICIENT LEARNING EQUILIBRIUM does not exist in general when the other agents ' payoffs can not be observed . in this paper we provide the first positive results on this problem , <unk> proving the existence of an optimal EFFICIENT LEARNING EQUILIBRIUM for the class of symmetric games where an agent can not observe other agents ' payoffs .

bounded confidence opinion dynamic models have received much recent interest as models of INFORMATION PROPAGATION in SOCIAL NETWORKS and LOCALIZED DISTRIBUTED AVERAGING . however in the existing literature , opinions are only viewed as abstract quantities rather than as part of a DECISION-MAKING SYSTEM . in this work , OPINION DYNAMICS are examined when agents are BAYESIAN DECISION MAKERS that perform HYPOTHESIS TESTING or SIGNAL DETECTION . BOUNDED CONFIDENCE is defined on PRIOR PROBABILITIES of hypotheses through BAYES RISK ERROR DIVERGENCE , the appropriate measure between PRIORS in HYPOTHESIS TESTING . this definition contrasts with the measure used between opinions in the standard model : absolute error . it is shown that the rapid convergence of PRIOR PROBABILITIES to a small number of LIMITING VALUES is similar to that seen in the standard model . the most interesting finding in this work is that the number of these LIMITING VALUES changes with the SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO in the HYPOTHESIS TESTING TASK . the number of final values or CLUSTERS is maximal at INTERMEDIATE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS , suggesting that the most <unk> issues lead to the largest number of <unk> .

spoken dialogue interfaces , mostly <unk> , become more visible in applications where attention needs to be shared with other tasks , such as driving a car . the deployment of the simple DIALOG SYSTEMS , instead of more sophisticated ones , is partly because the COMPUTING PLATFORMS used for such tasks have been less powerful and partly because certain issues from these cognitively challenging tasks have not been well addressed even in the most advanced DIALOG SYSTEMS . this paper reports the progress of our research effort in developing a robust , <unk> , and cognitive <unk> spoken dialog interface called CHAT : CONVERSATIONAL HELPER for AUTOMOTIVE TASKS . our research in the past few years has led to promising results , including high TASK COMPLETION RATE , DIALOG EFFICIENCY , and improved USER EXPERIENCE .

in this paper , a novel approach for SINGLE CHANNEL SOURCE SEPARATION using a DEEP NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE is introduced . unlike previous studies in which DEEP NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE and other CLASSIFIERS were used for CLASSIFYING TIME-FREQUENCY BINS to obtain hard masks for each source , we use the DEEP NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE to classify ESTIMATED SOURCE SPECTRA to check for their validity during separation . in the TRAINING STAGE , the TRAINING DATA for the source signals are used to train a DEEP NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE . in the SEPARATION STAGE , the trained DEEP NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE is utilized to aid in estimation of each source in the mixed signal . SINGLE CHANNEL SOURCE SEPARATION PROBLEM is formulated as an ENERGY MINIMIZATION PROBLEM where each source spectra estimate is encouraged to fit the trained DEEP NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE and the MIXED SIGNAL SPECTRUM is encouraged to be written as a weighted sum of the ESTIMATED SOURCE SPECTRA . the proposed approach works regardless of the ENERGY SCALE DIFFERENCES between the source signals in the training and separation stages . NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION is used to initialize the DEEP NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE for each source . the experimental results show that using DEEP NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE initialized by DEEP NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE for SOURCE SEPARATION improves the quality of the separated signal compared with using DEEP NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE for SOURCE SEPARATION .

in this paper we present the BEHAVIOSITE PARADIGM , a new approach to coordination and control of DISTRIBUTED AGENTS in a MULTIAGENT SYSTEM , inspired by BIOLOGICAL PARASITES with BEHAVIOR MANIPULATION PROPERTIES . BEHAVIOSITE PARADIGM are CODE MODULES that '' <unk> '' a MULTIAGENT SYSTEM , attaching themselves to agents and altering the SENSORY ACTIVITY and actions of those agents . these BEHAVIORAL CHANGES can be used to achieve altered , potentially improved , performance of the overall MULTIAGENT SYSTEM ; thus , BEHAVIOSITE PARADIGM provide a mechanism for DISTRIBUTED CONTROL over a DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM . BEHAVIOSITE PARADIGM need to be designed so that BEHAVIOSITE PARADIGM are intimately familiar with the internal <unk> of the environment and of the agents operating within it . to demonstrate our approach , we use <unk> to control the behavior of a SWARM of simple agents . with a relatively low INFECTION RATE , a few <unk> can <unk> desired behavior over the SWARM as a whole : keeping it in one place , leading it through <unk> , or moving the SWARM from one stable equilibrium to another . we contrast <unk> as a DISTRIBUTED SWARM CONTROL MECHANISM with alternatives , such as the use of group leaders , HERDERS , or SOCIAL NORMS .

in this paper , we study the use of different FREQUENCY WARP-FACTORS for different ACOUSTIC CLASSES in a computationally efficient framework of VOCAL TRACT LENGTH NORMALIZATION . this is motivated by the fact that all ACOUSTIC CLASSES do not exhibit similar spectral variations as a result of PHYSIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN VOCAL TRACT , and therefore , the use of a single FREQUENCY-WARP for the entire utterance may not be appropriate . we have recently proposed a VTLN METHOD that implements VOCAL TRACT LENGTH NORMALIZATION through a LINEAR-TRANSFORMATION of the conventional MFCC FEATURES and efficiently estimates the WARP-FACTOR using the same sufficient statistics as that are used in CMLLR ADAPTATION . in this paper we have shown that , in this framework of VOCAL TRACT LENGTH NORMALIZATION , and using the idea of REGRESSION CLASS TREE , we can obtain separate VOCAL TRACT LENGTH NORMALIZATION for different ACOUSTIC CLASSES . the use of REGRESSION CLASS TREE ensures that WARP-FACTOR is estimated for each class even when there is very little data available for that class . the ACOUSTIC CLASSES , in general , can be any collection of the GAUSSIAN COMPONENTS in the ACOUSTIC MODEL . we have built ACOUSTIC CLASSES by using DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH and by using PHONETIC KNOWLEDGE . using WSJ DATABASE we have shown the RECOGNITION performance of the proposed ACOUSTIC CLASS SPECIFIC WARP-FACTOR both for the data driven and the PHONETIC KNOWLEDGE BASED REGRESSION CLASS TREE DEFINITIONS and compare VTLN METHOD with the case of the single WARP-FACTOR . 
GEN
in this paper , we propose a data-driven approach for phonetic knowledge based regression class tree definitions based on phonetic knowledge . the warp-factor is based on the phonetic knowledge of a set of gaussian components . the warp-factor is based on the phonetic knowledge of a regression class tree , which is used for vocal tract length normalization . the warp-factor is based on the regression class tree , which is used for phonetic knowledge based regression class tree definitions in an acoustic model , and is used as a regression class tree for acoustic classes . the proposed vtln method is evaluated on the wsj database and compared with other mfcc features . the results show that the proposed vtln method outperforms the conventional mfcc features based on phonetic knowledge .

story generation is <unk> a <unk> , despite disappointing preliminary results from the preceding three decades . one of the principle reasons for previous <unk> was the low level of WRITING QUALITY , which resulted from the excessive focus of STORY GRAMMARS on PLOT DESIGN . although these systems leveraged NARRATIVE THEORY via CORPORA ANALYSES , they failed to thoroughly extend those analyses to all relevant linguistic levels . the end result was narratives that were recognizable as stories , but whose PROSE QUALITY was unsatisfactory . however , the <unk> for POOR WRITING QUALITY can not be laid <unk> at the feet of STORY GRAMMARS , as NATURAL LANGUAGE GENERATION has to-date not fielded systems capable of faithfully reproducing either the variety or COMPLEXITY of naturally occurring stories . this paper presents the AUTHOR ARCHITECTURE for accomplishing precisely that task , the <unk> implementation of a NARRATIVE PROSE GENERATOR , and a brief description of a formal evaluation of the stories it produces .

in this paper , we propose a new approach for data completion that exploits the structure of the model parameters of a class of generative models with statistical properties . we show that the wasserstein distance of the wasserstein distance can be expressed as a gradient of the kullback-leibler divergence of the boltzmann machines and the wasserstein distance of the model parameters . we also show how the method of denoising can be used to estimate the parameters of the model . the resulting algorithm , which we call boltzmann machine training , can be applied to the problem of data completion .

matrix approximation -lrb- ma -rrb- is one of the most popular techniques for COLLABORATIVE FILTERING . most existing MA METHODS train USER/ITEM LATENT FACTORS based on a USER-ITEM RATING MATRIX and then use the GLOBAL LATENT FACTORS to model all USERS/ITEMS . however , globally optimized LATENT FACTORS may not reflect the unique interests shared among only subsets of USERS/ITEMS , without which unique interests of users may not be accurately modelled . as a result , existing MA METHODS , which can not capture the uniqueness of different USER/ITEM , can not provide optimal recommendation . in this paper , a MIXTURE PROBABILISTIC MATRIX APPROXIMATION METHOD is proposed , which unifies globally optimized USER/ITEM feature vectors -lrb- on the entire RATING MATRIX -rrb- and LOCALLY OPTIMIZED USER/ITEM FEATURE VECTORS -lrb- on subsets of USER/ITEM RATINGS -rrb- to improve RECOMMENDATION ACCURACY . more specifically , in MIXTURE PROBABILISTIC MATRIX APPROXIMATION METHOD , a method is developed to find both globally and LOCALLY OPTIMIZED USER/ITEM FEATURE VECTORS . then , a GAUS-SIAN MIXTURE MODEL is adopted to combine GLOBAL PREDICTIONS and LOCAL PREDICTIONS to produce accurate rating predictions . experimental study using MOVIELENS AND NETFLIX DATASETS demonstrates that MIXTURE PROBABILISTIC MATRIX APPROXIMATION METHOD outperforms five state-of-the-art MA BASED CF METHODS in RECOMMENDATION ACCURACY with good scalability .

learning to hash involves learning HASH FUNCTIONS from a set of IMAGES for embedding HIGH-DIMENSIONAL VISUAL DESCRIPTORS into a SIMILARITY-PRESERVING LOW-DIMENSIONAL HAMMING SPACE . most of existing methods resort to a single representation of IMAGES , that is , only one type of VISUAL DESCRIPTORS is used to learn a HASH FUNCTION to assign BINARY CODES to IMAGES . however , IMAGES are often described by multiple different VISUAL DESCRIPTORS -lrb- such as SIFT , GIST , hog -rrb- , so it is desirable to incorporate these multiple representations into learning a HASH FUNCTION , leading to MULTI-VIEW HASHING . in this paper we present a SEQUENTIAL SPECTRAL LEARNING APPROACH to MULTI-VIEW HASHING where a HASH FUNCTION is sequentially determined by solving the successive <unk> of LOCAL VARIANCES subject to DECORRELATION CONSTRAINTS . we compute MULTI-VIEW LOCAL VARIANCES by -AVERAGING VIEW-SPECIFIC DISTANCE MATRICES such that the best AVERAGED DISTANCE MATRIX is determined by minimizing its <unk> from VIEW-SPECIFIC DISTANCE MATRICES . we also present a scalable implementation , exploiting a fast APPROXIMATE K-NN GRAPH CONSTRUCTION METHOD , in which -AVERAGED DISTANCES computed in SMALL PARTITIONS determined by RECURSIVE SPECTRAL BISECTION are gradually merged in conquer steps until whole examples are used . numerical experiments on <unk> , <unk> , and NUS-WIDE DATASETS confirm the high performance of our SEQUENTIAL SPECTRAL LEARNING APPROACH , in comparison to SINGLE-VIEW SPECTRAL HASHING as well as existing MULTI-VIEW HASHING METHODS .

permutation of the outputs at different FREQUENCY BINS remains as a major problem in the CONVOLUTIVE BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION . in this work a COUPLED HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL effectively exploits the PSYCHOACOUSTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF SIGNALS to mitigate such permutation . a JOINT DIAGONALIZATION ALGORITHM for CONVOLUTIVE BSS , which incorporates a NON-UNITARY PENALTY TERM within the CROSS-POWER SPECTRUM-BASED COST FUNCTION in the FREQUENCY DOMAIN , has been used . the proposed COUPLED HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL couples a number of conventional HMMS , equivalent to the number of outputs , by making STATE TRANSITIONS in each model dependent not only on its own previous state , but also on some aspects of the state of the other models . using this JOINT DIAGONALIZATION ALGORITHM the PERMUTATION EFFECT has been substantially reduced , and demonstrated using a number of SIMULATION STUDIES .

this paper discusses our THREE-STAGE APPROACH to a FLEXIBLE VOCABULARY SPEECH UNDERSTANDING SYSTEM , which can detect OUT-OF-VOCABULARY WORDS , and hypothesize their PHONETIC AND OR-THOGRAPHIC TRANSCRIPTIONS . in the first stage , we introduce the COLUMN-BIGRAM FINITE-STATE TRANSDUCER which , while embedding ANGIE SUBLEXICAL MODELS , also supports previously UNSEEN DATA from UNKNOWN WORDS . secondly , the ANGIE SUBLEXICAL MODELS utilize GRAPHEME INFORMATION , providing TIGHTER LINGUISTIC CONSTRAINT as well as INSTANTANEOUS SOUND-TO-LETTER CAPABILITY during RECOGNITION . thirdly , the SYLLABLE-LEVEL LEXICAL UNITS of the first stage are automatically derived via an ITERATIVE PROCEDURE to optimize performance . the THREE-STAGE APPROACH employs ANGIE SUBLEXICAL MODELS to output a WORD NETWORK which is parsed by TINA , our NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSOR , in stage three . experiments with a JUPITER IMPLEMENTATION of this THREE-STAGE APPROACH are described in -lsb- 1 -rsb- .

we consider the DATA STREAM of reconstructing a DATA STREAM from a small subset of its entries , where the DATA STREAM is assumed to lie in a LOW-DIMENSIONAL LINEAR SUBSPACE , possibly corrupted by noise . it is also important to track the change of underlying SUBSPACE for many applications . this DATA STREAM can be viewed as a SEQUENTIAL LOW-RANK MATRIX COMPLETION PROBLEM in which the SUBSPACE is learned in an ONLINE FASHION . the proposed algorithm , called PARALLEL ESTIMATION AND TRACKING by RECURSIVE LEAST SQUARES , identifies the underlying LOW-DIMENSIONAL SUBSPACE via a RECURSIVE PROCEDURE for each row of the SUBSPACE MATRIX in parallel , and then reconstructs the missing entries via LEAST-SQUARES ESTIMATION if required .

robust <unk> is defined for the ANALYSIS OF SIGNALS with HEAVY-TAILED DISTRIBUTION NOISE . in the form of a robust spectrogram -lrb- <unk> -rrb- RSPEC BASED INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY ESTIMATOR can be used for the ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY SIGNALS . in this paper a RSPEC BASED INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY ESTIMATOR , with a TIME-VARYING WINDOW LENGTH , is presented . the optimal choice of the WINDOW LENGTH can resolve the BIAS-VARIANCE TRADE-OFF in the RSPEC BASED IF ESTIMATION . however , RSPEC BASED INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY ESTIMATOR depends on the unknown nonlinearity of the RSPEC BASED INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY ESTIMATOR . the RSPEC BASED INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY ESTIMATOR used in this paper is able to provide the ACCURACY close to the one that could be achieved if the RSPEC BASED INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY ESTIMATOR , to be estimated , were known in advance . simulations show good ACCURACY ability of the ADAPTIVE ALGORITHM and good robustness property with respect to RARE HIGH MAGNITUDE NOISE VALUES .

in VISUAL RECOGNITION PROBLEMS , the common DATA DISTRIBUTION MISMATCHES between training and testing make DOMAIN ADAPTATION essential . however , IMAGE DATA is difficult to manually divide into the DISCRETE DOMAINS required by ADAPTATION ALGORITHMS , and the standard practice of <unk> datasets with domains is a weak proxy for all the real conditions that alter the statistics in complex ways -lrb- lighting , POSE , BACKGROUND , RESOLUTION , etc. -rrb- we propose an approach to automatically discover LATENT DOMAINS in IMAGE OR VIDEO DATASETS . our formulation imposes two key properties on domains : MAXIMUM DISTINCTIVENESS and MAXIMUM LEARNABILITY . by MAXIMUM DISTINCTIVENESS , we require the underlying distributions of the identified domains to be different from each other to the MAXIMUM EXTENT ; by MAXIMUM LEARNABILITY , we ensure that a strong DISCRIMINATIVE MODEL can be learned from the domain . we devise a NONPARAMETRIC FORMULATION and efficient OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURE that can successfully discover domains among both TRAINING AND TEST DATA . we extensively evaluate our approach on OBJECT RECOGNITION and HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION TASKS .

the CODING EFFICIENCY of the new VIDEO CODING STANDARD , HIGH EFFICIENCY VIDEO CODING , is strongly associated with better use of SPATIO-TEMPORAL REDUNDANCIES thanks to an increased number of competing CODING MODES . however , this competition involves a massive increase in SIGNALING BITRATE which becomes a possible limit for the next generation of EN-CODER . this paper proposes a new CODING SCHEME that breaks with conventional approaches . CODING SCHEME exploits a more complex DECODER able to reproduce the choice of the ENCODER based on CAUSAL REFERENCES , eliminating thus the need to SIGNAL CODING MODES and associated parameters . the general outline of this new CODING SCHEME and a proposed implementation are described in this paper . experimental results under common test conditions report an AVERAGE BITRATE SAVING of 1.7 % at the same quality compared to HEVC for a wide range of VIDEO SEQUENCES .
